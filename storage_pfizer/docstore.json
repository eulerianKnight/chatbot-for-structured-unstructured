We seek to enhance the value of our medicines and vaccines and actively engage in dialogues about how we can best work with patients, physicians and payers to prevent\nand treat disease and improve outcomes. We seek to maximize patient access and evaluate our pricing arrangements and contracting methods with payers to minimize adverse impact on\nour revenues within the current legal and pricing structures.\nWe are committed to fulfilling our purpose: Breakthroughs that change patients\u2019 lives. Our purpose fuels everything we do and reflects both our passion for science and our commitment to\npatients.\nIn addition, Pfizer continues to enhance its ESG strategy, which is focused on six areas where we see opportunities to create a meaningful impact: product innovation; equitable access and\npricing; product quality and safety; diversity, equity and inclusion; climate change; and business ethics.\nWe are committed to strategically capitalizing on growth opportunities, primarily by advancing our own product pipeline and maximizing the value of our existing products, but also through\nvarious business development activities.

In addition to discovering and developing new products, our R&D efforts seek to add value to our existing products by improving their effectiveness and ease of\ndosing and by discovering potential new indications.\nOur R&D Priorities and Strategy. Our R&D priorities include:\n\u2022delivering a pipeline of highly differentiated medicines and vaccines where we have a unique opportunity to bring the most important new therapies to patients in need;\n\u2022advancing our capabilities that can position us for long-term R&D leadership; and\n\u2022advancing new models for partnerships with creativity, flexibility and urgency to deliver innovation to patients as quickly as possible.\nTo that end, our R&D primarily focuses on our main therapeutic areas, which are inflammation and immunology, internal medicine, oncology, rare diseases, vaccines, and anti-infectives.\nWhile a significant portion of our R&D is internal, we also seek promising chemical and biological lead molecules and innovative technologies developed by others to incorporate into", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3598, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8133dd68-60f0-4769-b6bc-0896aa25baf6": {"__data__": {"id_": "8133dd68-60f0-4769-b6bc-0896aa25baf6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "pfizer_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "data\\pfizer_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf_part_10", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "pfizer_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "02077c89158df3c99908742d91790d5e27aa94e4a5e3db58fb70f61a46c5da25"}, "2": {"node_id": "ab1ab45c-7022-4edc-8d54-6748d7db6617", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "pfizer_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "d5dad5ee8a604a4c808f29fecc4769171d23efc472f30163e8c89a85386c2d7f"}}, "hash": "a6003fd046405d71c572d2526710e8fe76f41ff1e5f0ef16cfae18935ac6611c", "text": "lead molecules and innovative technologies developed by others to incorporate into our\ndiscovery and development processes or projects, as well as our portfolio.

In 2022, we continued to strengthen our global R&D operations and pursue strategies to improve R&D productivity to achieve a sustainable pipeline that is positioned\nto deliver value in the near term and over time. Our R&D activity is conducted through various platform functions that operate in parallel within our global operations, including the following:\n\u2022WRDM. Research units within WRDM are generally responsible for research and early-stage development assets for our business (assets that have not yet achieved proof-of-concept)\nand are organized by therapeutic area to enhance flexibility, cohesiveness and focus. We can rapidly redeploy resources within a research unit and between various projects to leverage,\nas necessary, common skills, expertise or focus. Science-based platform-services organizations within WRDM provide technical expertise and other services to various R&D projects and\nare organized into science-based functions. These organizations allow us to react more quickly and effectively to evolving needs by sharing resources among projects, candidates and\ntargets across therapeutic areas and phases of development.\n\u2022GPD. Our GPD organization is a unified center for clinical development and regulatory activities that is generally responsible for the clinical development strategy and operational\nexecution of clinical trials for both early- and late-stage clinical assets in Pfizer\u2019s pipeline.\nWe manage R&D operations on a total-company basis through our platform functions described above. Specifically, the Portfolio Management Team (PMT), composed of senior executives,\nis accountable for aligning resources among all of our WRDM, GPD and R&D projects and for seeking to ensure optimal capital allocation across the innovative R&D portfolio. We believe\nthat this approach also serves to maximize accountability and flexibility.\nPfizer Inc. 2022 Form 10-K 4", "start_char_idx": 3516, "end_char_idx": 6182, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8284999d-24ad-4a2f-99d3-c06434cde357": {"__data__": {"id_": "8284999d-24ad-4a2f-99d3-c06434cde357", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "pfizer_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "data\\pfizer_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf_part_11", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "pfizer_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "f469caa6db8ff9b907ea8f45db88272b6d2825f27e7b0f2c38bff49d5c0b7788"}, "3": {"node_id": "81020002-a7d7-4e65-90f1-2b7a457437ed", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "pfizer_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "54e90523340a14e376c764001c85c5f769293d5eb2370d60796cfb401da5b4bb"}}, "hash": "e00fbc982f6ae388b865f47e8d738fafcbb431346517b48502468d223018baca", "text": "We do not disaggregate total R&D expense by development phase or by therapeutic area since, as described above, we do not manage all of our R&D operations by development phase or\nby therapeutic area.

The process of drug and biological product discovery from initiation through development and to potential regulatory approval is lengthy and can take more than ten\nyears. As of January 31, 2023, we had the following number of projects in various stages of R&D:\nDevelopment of a single compound is often pursued as part of multiple programs. While our drug candidates may or may not receive regulatory approval, new candidates entering clinical\ndevelopment phases are the foundation for future products. Information concerning several of our drug candidates in development, as well as supplemental filings for existing products, is\nset forth in the Product Developments section within MD&A. The discovery and development of drugs, vaccines and biological products are time consuming, costly and unpredictable. For\ninformation on the risks associated with R&D, see the Item 1A.

In 2022, we principally sold Paxlovid to government agencies. In the U.S., we primarily sell our vaccines directly to the federal government, CDC, wholesalers, individual\nprovider offices, retail pharmacies and integrated delivery systems. Outside the U.S., we primarily sell our vaccines to government and non-government institutions. Certain of these\ngovernment contracts may be renegotiated or terminated at the discretion of a government entity. In addition, our contracts with government and supranational organizations for the sales of\nComirnaty and Paxlovid, which are binding contracts, represented a significant amount of revenues in 2022. To date, we primarily sold Comirnaty and Paxlovid globally under government\ncontracts. We expect sales of Comirnaty and Paxlovid in the U.S. will transition to commercial channels in the second half of 2023. We also seek to gain access for our products on\nformularies, which are lists of approved medicines available to members of healthcare programs or PBMs. PBMs use various benefit designs, such as tiered co-pays for formulary products,\nto drive utilization of products in preferred formulary positions. We may also work with payers on disease management programs that help to develop tools and materials to educate patients\nand physicians on key disease areas. For information on our significant customers, see Note 17C.\nWe promote our products to healthcare providers and patients consistent with applicable laws. Through our marketing organizations, we explain the approved uses, benefits and risks of our\nproducts to healthcare providers and patients; MCOs that provide insurance coverage, such as hospitals, integrated delivery systems, PBMs and health plans; and employers and\ngovernment agencies who hire MCOs to provide health benefits to their employees. In the U.S., we market directly to consumers through direct-to-consumer advertising that seeks to\ncommunicate the approved uses, benefits and risks of our products while motivating people to have meaningful conversations with their doctors.

Protecting our trademarks is of material importance to Pfizer.\nCOMPETITION\nOur business is conducted in intensely competitive and often highly regulated markets. Many of our products face competition in the form of branded or generic drugs or biosimilars that\ntreat similar diseases or indications. The principal forms of competition include efficacy, safety, ease of use and cost. Though the means of competition vary among our products,\ndemonstrating the value of our products is a critical factor for success.\nWe compete with other companies that manufacture and sell products that treat or prevent diseases or indications similar to those treated or prevented by our major products. These\ncompetitors include other worldwide research-based biopharmaceutical companies, smaller research companies with more limited therapeutic focus and generic drug and biosimilar\nmanufacturers. Our competitors also may devote substantial funds and resources to R&D and their successful R&D could result in erosion of the sales of our existing products and potential\nsales of products in development, as well as unanticipated product obsolescence. In addition, several of our competitors operate without large R&D expenses and make a regular practice of\nchallenging our product patents before their expiration.\nTo address competitive trends we continually emphasize innovation, which is underscored by our multi-billion-dollar investment in R&D, as well as our business development transactions,\nboth designed to result in a strong and differentiated product pipeline. Our investment in research continues even after drug or vaccine approval as we seek to further demonstrate the value\nof our products for the conditions they treat or prevent, as well as potential new applications. We educate patients, physicians, payers and global health authorities on the benefits and risks\nof our medicines and vaccines, and seek to continually enhance the organizational effectiveness of our biopharmaceutical functions, including to accurately and ethically launch and market\nour products to our customers.\nOperating conditions have also shifted as a result of increased global competitive pressures, industry regulation and cost containment.

Generic pharmaceutical manufacturers pose one of the biggest competitive challenges to our branded small molecule products because they can market a competing\nversion of our product after the expiration or loss of our patent and often charge much less. Several competitors regularly challenge our product patents before their expiration. Generic\ncompetitors often operate without large R&D expenses, as well as without costs of conveying medical information about products to the medical community. In addition, the FDA approval\nprocess exempts generics from costly and time-consuming clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy, allowing generic manufacturers to rely on the safety and efficacy data of the\ninnovator product. In China, for example, we expect to continue to face intensified competition by certain generic manufacturers in 2023 and beyond, which may result in price cuts and\nvolume loss of some of our products. In addition, generic versions of competitors\u2019 branded products may also compete with our products.\nMCOs that focus primarily on the immediate cost of drugs often favor generics over brand-name drugs. Many governments also encourage the use of generics as alternatives to brand-\nname drugs in their healthcare programs, including Medicaid in the U.S., and U.S. laws generally allow, and in some cases require, pharmacists to substitute generic drugs for brand-name\ndrugs. In a small subset of states, prescribing physicians are able to expressly prevent such substitution.\nBiosimilars. Certain of our biologic products, including Enbrel (we market Enbrel outside the U.S. and Canada), already face, or may face in the future, competition from biosimilars (also\nreferred to as follow-on biologics). Biosimilars are versions of biologic medicines that have been developed and proven to be highly similar to the original biologic in terms of safety and\nefficacy and that have no clinically meaningful differences in safety, purity or potency. Biosimilars have the potential to offer high-quality, lower-cost alternatives to innovative biologic\nmedicines. In the U.S., biosimilars referencing innovative biologic products are approved under the U.S. Public Health Service Act.\nPfizer Inc. 2022 Form 10-K 8", "start_char_idx": 4175, "end_char_idx": 7800, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0f8056d0-7e97-404f-ac08-3eeacb211018": {"__data__": {"id_": "0f8056d0-7e97-404f-ac08-3eeacb211018", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "pfizer_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "data\\pfizer_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf_part_15", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "pfizer_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "254d093793f4d7fb645dc840f3d6bb3f654c249713d53164953ef8f501d1d766"}, "3": {"node_id": "4b0016b6-1ba1-4c2f-b1c7-8c2de84f50ab", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "pfizer_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "383de79029707efe9bb0b737ad48ec0f66ef78dc51aeaef56223aec839beb8fe"}}, "hash": "4935c1b32cb4da325541acb3df94113282e85e50ca730c12bcde6bde44359edc", "text": "PRICING PRESSURES AND MANAGED CARE ORGANIZA TIONS\nCommercial Pricing Pressures. Pricing and access pressures in the commercial sector continue to be significant. Overall, there is increasing pressure on U.S. providers to deliver healthcare\nat a lower cost and to ensure that those expenditures deliver demonstrated value in terms of health outcomes. Many employers have adopted or make available high deductible health\nplans, which can increase out-of-pocket costs for medicines. This trend is likely to continue. Private third-party payers, such as health plans, increasingly challenge pharmaceutical product\npricing, which could result in lower prices, lower reimbursement rates for payors and a reduction in demand for our products, including denial of coverage of our products, if lower cost\nalternatives are available. Pricing pressures also may occur as a result of highly competitive insurance markets. Healthcare provider purchasers, directly or through group purchasing\norganizations, are seeking enhanced discounts or implementing more rigorous bidding or purchasing review processes.\nLonger term, we foresee a shift among payors and their pharmacy benefits managers in focus away from fee-for-service reimbursement towards outcomes-based payments and risk-\nsharing arrangements that reward providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers for cost reductions and improved patient outcomes. These new payment models can, at times, lead to lower\nprices for, and restricted access to, new medicines. At the same time, these models can also promote utilization of drugs by encouraging physicians to screen and diagnose and consider\ndrugs as a means of forestalling more costly medical interventions. Further, these models may also encourage payors and their pharmacy benefits managers to cover higher cost drugs\nwhere coverage is tied to patient outcomes and other quality incentives.\nThe impact of COVID-19 and related large-scale healthcare disruptions on the pace of adoption of value-based payment models remains unclear. Both payors and providers may resist\nadopting such models or choose to adopt such models at a slower pace if the incentives available do not outweigh the financial risk involved. Unprecedented pressures on critical care and\nthe reductions in elective surgeries during the COVID-19 pandemic undermined revenue predictability for hospitals and other institutional providers. As a result, providers may weigh their\nability to take on the financial risk of downside value-based payment models. In contrast, providers in more advanced value-based payment models, such as full capitation, a fixed amount\npaid in advance per patient per unit of time-period, generally found their revenues remained steady during the pandemic, which may ultimately encourage the growth of such models. Going\nforward, we expect continued focus on value-based payment models that support financial resiliency and advance health care equity by incorporating features intended to reduce disparities\nin health care quality and access experienced by underrepresented and underserved populations.\nWe believe medicines and vaccines are the most efficient and effective use of healthcare dollars based on the value they deliver to the overall healthcare system. We work with law makers\nand advocate for solutions that effectively improve patient health outcomes, lower costs to the healthcare system, and help ensure access to medicines and vaccines within an efficient and\naffordable healthcare system. This includes assessing our go-to market model to address patient affordability challenges.

Business\u2014Government Regulation and Price Constraints and Item 1A. Risk Factors\u2014Pricing and Reimbursement\nsections in this Form 10-K.\nManaged Care Organizations. The evolution of managed care in the U.S. has been a major factor in the competitiveness of the healthcare marketplace. Approximately 307 million people in\nthe U.S. now have some form of health insurance coverage, and the marketing of prescription drugs and vaccines to both consumers and the entities that manage coverage in the U.S.\ncontinues to grow in importance. In particular, the influence of MCOs has increased in recent years due to the growing number of patients receiving coverage through MCOs. At the same\ntime, consolidation in the MCO industry has resulted in fewer, even larger MCOs, which enhances those MCOs\u2019 ability to negotiate lower pricing and further increases their importance to\nour business. Since MCOs seek to contain and reduce healthcare expenditures, their growing influence has increased downward pressure on drug prices, as well as negatively impacted\nrevenues.\nMCOs and their PBMs typically negotiate prices with pharmaceutical providers by using formularies (which are lists of approved medicines available to MCO members), clinical protocols\n(which require prior authorization for a branded product if a generic product is available or require the patient to first fail on one or more generic products before permitting access to a\nbranded medicine), volume purchasing, long-term contracts and their ability to influence volume and market share of prescription drugs. In addition, by placing branded medicines on higher-\ntier or non-preferred status in their formularies, MCOs transfer to the patient higher patient out-of-pocket expenses. This financial disincentive is a tool for MCOs to manage drug costs and\nchannel patients to medicines preferred by the MCOs. We expect payment reforms for MCOs will continue to evolve with increased emphasis on expanded participation and on removing\nbarriers to equitable health care.\nThe breadth of the products covered by formularies can vary considerably from one MCO to another, and many formularies include alternative and competitive products for treatment of\nparticular medical problems. MCOs emphasize primary and preventive care, out-patient treatment and procedures performed at doctors\u2019 offices and clinics as ways to manage costs.\nHospitalization and surgery, typically the most expensive forms of treatment, are carefully managed, and drugs that can help in chronic care management and reduce the need for\nhospitalization, professional therapy or surgery may become favored first-line treatments for certain diseases. At the same time, MCOs may seek to exclude high-cost drugs from\nformularies in their efforts to manage and lower their costs.\nExclusion of a product from a formulary or other MCO-implemented restrictions can significantly impact drug usage in the MCO patient population and beyond. Consequently,\npharmaceutical companies compete to gain access to formularies for their products, typically on the basis of unique product features, such as greater efficacy, better patient ease of use, or\nfewer side effects, as well as the overall cost of the therapy. We continue to seek to ensure that our major products are included on MCO formularies. However, increasingly our branded\nproducts are being placed on the higher tiers or in a non-preferred status.

Risk Factors\u2014Managed Care Trends section in this Form 10-K.\nRAW MA TERIALS\nWe procure raw materials essential to our business from numerous suppliers worldwide.

We are continuing to monitor and implement mitigation strategies in an effort to reduce any potential risk or impact, including active supplier management, qualification of\nadditional suppliers and advanced purchasing to the extent possible.\nGOVERNMENT REGULA TION AND PRICE CONSTRAINTS\nWe are subject to extensive regulation by government authorities in the countries in which we do business. This includes laws and regulations governing the operations of\nbiopharmaceutical companies, such as the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products, pricing (including discounts and rebates) and data privacy, among others. These laws and\nregulations may require administrative guidance for implementation, and a failure to comply could subject us to legal and/or administrative actions. Enforcement measures may include\nsubstantial fines and/or penalties, orders to stop non-compliant activities, criminal charges, warning letters, product recalls or seizures, delays in product approvals, exclusion from\nparticipation in government programs or contracts as well as limitations on conducting business in applicable jurisdictions, and could result in harm to our reputation and business. For\nadditional information, see Note 16A. Compliance with these laws and regulations may be costly, and may require significant technical expertise and capital investment to ensure\ncompliance. While capital expenditures or operating costs for compliance with government regulations cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not currently anticipate they will have a\nmaterial effect on our capital expenditures or competitive position.\nIn the United States\nDrug and Biologic Regulation. The FDA, pursuant to the FFDCA, the Public Health Service Act and other federal statutes and regulations, extensively regulates pre- and post-marketing\nactivities related to our biopharmaceutical products. The regulations govern areas such as the safety and efficacy of medicines and vaccines, clinical trials, advertising and promotion,\nquality control, manufacturing, labeling, distribution, post-marketing safety surveillance and reporting, and record keeping. Other U.S. federal agencies, including the DEA, also regulate\ncertain of our products and activities.\nFor a biopharmaceutical company to market a drug or a biologic product, including vaccines, in the U.S., the FDA must evaluate whether the product is safe and effective for its intended\nuse. If the FDA determines that the drug or biologic is safe and effective, the FDA will approve the product\u2019s NDA or BLA (or supplemental NDA or supplemental BLA), as appropriate.\nA drug or biologic may be subject to postmarketing commitments, which are studies or clinical trials that the product sponsor agrees to conduct, or postmarketing requirements, which are\nstudies or clinical trials that are required as a condition of approval. In addition, we are also required to report adverse events and comply with cGMP (the FDA regulations that govern all\naspects of manufacturing quality for pharmaceuticals) and the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (the law that, among other things, sets forth requirements related to product tracing, product\nidentifiers and verification for manufacturers, wholesale distributors, repackagers and dispensers to facilitate the tracing of product through the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain), as\nwell as advertising and promotion regulations.

Risk Factors\u2014Development, Regulatory Approval and Marketing of Products and \u2014Post-\nAuthorization/Approval Data sections in this Form 10-K.\nIn the context of public health emergencies, like the COVID-19 pandemic, we may apply to the FDA for an EUA, which, if granted, allows for the distribution and use of our products during\nthe declared emergency, in accordance with the conditions set forth in the EUA, unless the EUA is terminated by the government. Although the criteria for an EUA differ from the criteria for\napproval of an NDA or BLA, EUAs nevertheless require the development and submission of data to satisfy the relevant FDA standards, and a number of ongoing obligations.

The FDA\ngenerally expects EUA holders to work toward submission of full applications, such as a BLA or an NDA, as soon as possible.\nBiosimilar Regulation. The FDA is responsible for approval of biosimilars. Innovator biologics, or reference products, are entitled to 12 years exclusivity. Applications for biosimilars may not\nbe submitted until four years after the date on which the reference product was first licensed and may not be approved until 12 years after the reference product was first licensed.\nSales and Marketing Regulations. Our marketing practices are subject to state laws, as well as federal laws, such as the Anti-Kickback Statute and False Claims Act, intended to prevent\nfraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. The Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits corruptly soliciting, offering, receiving, or paying anything of value to generate business. The False Claims Act\ngenerally prohibits anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented, any claims for payment for goods or services, including to government payers, such as\nMedicare and Medicaid, that are false or fraudulent and generally treat claims generated through kickbacks as false or fraudulent. The federal government and states also regulate sales\nand marketing activities and financial interactions between manufacturers and healthcare providers, requiring disclosure to government authorities and the public of such interactions, and\nthe adoption of compliance standards or programs. State attorneys general have also taken action to regulate the marketing of prescription drugs under state consumer protection and false\nadvertising laws.\nPricing, Reimbursement and Access Regulations. Pricing and reimbursement for our products depend in part on government regulation. Any significant efforts at the federal or state levels to\nreform the healthcare system by changing the way healthcare is provided or funded or more directly impose controls on drug pricing, government reimbursement, and access to medicines\nand vaccines on public and private insurance plans could have a material impact on us.\nIn addition, in order to have our products covered by Medicaid, we must offer discounts or rebates on purchases of pharmaceutical products under various federal and state programs. We\nalso must report specific prices to government agencies. The calculations necessary to determine the prices reported are complex and the failure to do so accurately may expose us to\nenforcement measures. See the discussion regarding rebates in the Revenue Deductions section within MD&A and Note 1G.\nGovernment and private payers routinely seek to manage utilization and control the costs of our products, and there is considerable public and government scrutiny of pharmaceutical\npricing. Efforts by states and the federal government to regulate prices or payment for pharmaceutical products, including proposed actions to facilitate drug importation, limit reimbursement\nto lower international reference prices, require deep discounts, and require manufacturers to report and make public price increases and sometimes a written justification for the increase,\ncould adversely affect our business if implemented. We expect to see continued focus by Congress and the Biden Administration on regulating pricing, which could result in legislative and\nregulatory changes designed to control costs. For example, in August 2022, the IRA was signed into law, which, among other things, requires manufacturers of certain drugs to engage in\nprice negotiations with Medicare (beginning in 2026), imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation (first due in 2023), and\nreplaces the Part D coverage gap discount program with a new discounting program (beginning in 2025). We continue to evaluate the impact of the IRA on our business, operations and\nfinancial condition and results as the full effect of the IRA on our business and the pharmaceutical industry remains uncertain. In addition, changes to the Medicaid program or the federal\n340B drug pricing program, which imposes ceilings on prices that drug manufacturers can charge for medications sold to certain health care facilities,", "start_char_idx": 4096, "end_char_idx": 8390, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ee966245-7f36-41b8-9dee-6e67c5719015": {"__data__": {"id_": "ee966245-7f36-41b8-9dee-6e67c5719015", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "pfizer_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "data\\pfizer_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf_part_16", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "pfizer_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "421f468f02b04304d8f797c4d33e8f455cce176db7151fa4fcfb42f2e846ba6a"}, "2": {"node_id": "142e930a-5559-4770-931d-bd3fbb76f582", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "pfizer_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "7b06f8df47bf8a7400a0b501d84270da3b254dd7a98b9c2c5b95a6da95ae56a9"}}, "hash": "741f16af6e3058fa5da043c9e7c97a444897d13b6a19a0f6954fa918d1513710", "text": "on prices that drug manufacturers can charge for medications sold to certain health care facilities, could have a material impact on our\nbusiness.

The HHS has sent letters to numerous manufacturers that have also implemented contract pharmacy integrity initiatives expressing the view that their programs are in\nviolation of the 340B statute, and referring those programs for potential enforcement action. Several manufacturers have challenged HHS\u2019s enforcement letters in federal court and litigation\nis ongoing in those cases. We believe that our program is consistent with the statute.

For additional information, see the\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\u2014Pricing and Reimbursement section in this Form 10-K.\nA majority of states use preferred drug lists to manage access to pharmaceutical products under Medicaid, including some of our products. For example, access to our products under the\nMedicaid managed care programs typically is determined by the health plans with which state Medicaid agencies contract to provide services to beneficiaries. States seek to control\nhealthcare costs related to Medicaid and other state healthcare programs, including the implementation of supplemental rebate agreements under the Medicaid drug rebate program tied to\npatient outcomes. States\u2019 budgets were impacted less by the COVID-19 pandemic than expected and are generally growing. However, we expect states will continue to seek cost cutting\nwithin Medicaid, which may focus on managed care capitation payments and/or formulary management. States may also advance drug-pricing initiatives with a focus on affordability review\nboards, financial penalties related to pricing practices, manufacturer pricing and reporting requirements, as well as regulation of prescription drug assistance, copay accumulator, or copay\nmaximizer programs in the commercial market. Payers may promote generic drugs and biosimilars more aggressively to generate savings and attempt to stimulate additional price\ncompetition. In addition, we expect that consolidation and integration among pharmacy chains, wholesalers and PBMs will increase pricing pressures in the industry. For additional\ninformation, see the Item 1A.

Outside developed markets, pharmacovigilance\nrequirements vary and are generally not as extensive, but there is a trend toward increasing regulation.\nPricing and Reimbursement. Certain governments, including in the different EU member states, the U.K., Japan, China, Canada and South Korea, provide healthcare at low-to-zero direct\ncost to consumers at the point of care and have significant power to regulate pharmaceutical prices or patient reimbursement levels to control costs for the government-sponsored\nhealthcare system, particularly under recent global financing pressures. Governments globally may use a variety of measures to control costs, including, among others, proposing price\nreform or legislation, cross country collaboration and procurement, price cuts, mandatory rebates, health technology assessments, forced localization as a condition of market access,\n\u201cinternational reference pricing\u201d (i.e., the practice of a country linking its regulated medicine prices to those of other countries), QCE processes and VBP. In addition, the international\npatchwork of price regulation, differing economic conditions and incomplete value assessments across countries has led to varying access to quality medicines in many markets and some\nthird-party trade in our products between countries. Several important multilateral organizations such as the World Health Organization are increasing scrutiny of international\npharmaceutical pricing through policy recommendations and sponsorship of programs, such as \u201cThe Oslo Medicines Initiative\u201d which aims to ensure \u201caffordability for high-priced medicines\u201d.\nIn November 2020, the EC published its Pharmaceutical Strategy for Europe which envisions a broad range of new initiatives and legislation including a significant focus on tackling the\npersisting inequalities on access, affordability and availability of medicines across the EU.\nIn China, pricing pressures have increased in recent years because of an overall focus on healthcare cost containment with the central government emphasizing improved health outcomes\nand decreased drug prices as key indicators of progress towards its healthcare reform. For patented products, drug prices have decreased dramatically as a result of adding innovative\ndrugs (including oncology medicines and orphan drugs) to the National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL) via access-price negotiation. In the off-patent space, numerous local generics\nhave been officially deemed bioequivalent under a QCE process that required generic drugs to pass a test to assess their bioequivalence to a qualified reference drug (typically the\noriginator drug). A centralized VBP program\u2014a tendering process where a certain portion of included molecule volumes are guaranteed to tender winners\u2014aims to contain healthcare costs\nby driving utilization of generics that have passed QCE. This has resulted in further lowering the price of medicines, especially off-patent medicines; this trend is expected to continue.\nFurthermore, the Chinese government has promulgated price bidding rules in June 2022 for enlisting off-patent products (excluding VBP products and certain products directly priced by\ngovernment) onto the NRDL with the goal of unifying the reimbursement price between QCE-approved generic medicines and the applicable original medicines. Pfizer, along with most off-\npatent originators, have mostly not been successful in the VBP bidding process. The government has indicated that additional post-LOE drugs (including biological products) could be\nsubjected to VBP qualification in future rounds. Certain of our products, such as Sulperazon and Vfend injectables, are likely to be included in future rounds.

Several countries have implemented laws requiring (or industry trade associations have recommended) disclosure of transfers of value\nmade by pharmaceutical companies to healthcare providers and/or healthcare organizations, such as academic teaching hospitals.\nIntellectual Property. Reliable patent protection and enforcement around the world are among the key factors we consider for continued business and R&D investment. The WTO\nAgreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (WTO-TRIPS) requires participant countries to provide patent and other intellectual property-related protection for\npharmaceutical products by law, with a time-limited exemption provided for least-developed countries. While some countries have made improvements, we still face patent grant,\nenforcement and other intellectual property challenges in many countries.\nWhile the global intellectual property policy environment has generally improved following implementation of WTO-TRIPS and bilateral/multilateral trade agreements, our growth and ability\nto bring new product innovation to patients depends on further progress in intellectual property protection. In certain developed international markets, governments maintain relatively\neffective intellectual property policies. However, in the EU, pursuant to the ongoing review of pharmaceutical intellectual property and regulatory incentives, legislative proposals expected to\nbe introduced in 2023 may result in the reduction of certain protections. In several emerging market countries, governments have used intellectual property policies as a tool to force\ninnovators to accept less than fair value for medicines, as well as to advance industrial policy and localization goals. The WTO continues to address the role of intellectual property in the\ncontext of the COVID-19 pandemic response. This includes the June 2022 Ministerial Decision on the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, which seeks to\nmake it easier for certain WTO members to issue a compulsory license on COVID-19 vaccines, and discussions continue on whether to expand that decision to COVID-19 therapeutics and\ndiagnostics.\nConsiderable political and economic pressure has weakened current intellectual property protection in some countries and has led to policies such as more restrictive standards for\nobtaining patents and more difficult procedures for patenting biopharmaceutical inventions, restrictions on patenting certain types of inventions, revocation of patents, laws or regulations\nthat promote or provide broad discretion to issue a compulsory license, weak intellectual property enforcement and failure to implement effective regulatory data protection.\nOur industry advocacy efforts focus on seeking a fair and transparent business environment for foreign manufacturers, underscoring the importance of strong intellectual property systems\nfor local innovative industries and helping improve patients\u2019 access to innovative medicines and vaccines.\nData Privacy. Outside of the U.S., many countries have privacy and data security laws and regulations concerning the collection and use of personal data, including but not limited to, the\nEU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulations and China\u2019s Personal Information Protection Law. The legislative and regulatory framework for privacy and data protection issues worldwide is\nalso rapidly evolving as countries continue to adopt new and updated privacy and data security laws. The interpretation and application of such laws and regulations remain uncertain and\ncontinues to evolve. In addition, enforcement of such laws and regulations is increasing.\nENVIRONMENT AL MATTERS\nOur operations are affected by national, state and/or local environmental laws.

In 2022, we announced a new goal to further reduce GHG emissions and\nachieve the Science Based Target Initiative\u2019s voluntary Net-Zero Standard by 2040. As part of this goal, Pfizer aims to decrease its GHG emissions by 95% and its value chain emissions by\n90% from 2019 levels by 2040. To support our goal, we are developing our emission reduction plan, which will include strategies to achieve reductions throughout our value chain including\ninvesting in new technologies and innovative climate solutions, and urging all of our suppliers to unite with us in making a commitment to action and integrating ambitious climate impact\nreduction targets into their management processes. Related expenses and capital spending incurred for 2022 were not material to our consolidated financial statements. While capital and\noperational expenditures will be incurred to meet our goal, we do not currently anticipate they will have a material effect on our financial position in the near term. Longer term uncertainties\nregarding availability of commercially available technologies among others make it difficult to predict the financial impact of meeting the goal and we will continue to assess and monitor the\nfinancial impact of the emission reduction plan.\nFor a discussion of the risks associated with climate change and our environmental initiatives, see the Item 1A.

To attract, develop and inspire the brightest talent, we aim to support our colleagues by engaging and partnering with them to help ensure they feel they are part of\na community. We understand the importance of continuously listening and responding to colleague feedback and our annual engagement survey, Pfizer Pulse, provides a forum for our\ncolleagues to give structured feedback about their colleague experience. Through this survey, we measure and track key areas of the overall colleague experience and equip leaders with\nactionable insights for discussion and follow up. Regular topics in the survey include: (i) employee engagement, such as colleagues\u2019 commitment to and advocacy for Pfizer; (ii) purpose,\nincluding how colleagues\u2019 work connects with our purpose; (iii) inclusion, such as having a climate in which diverse perspectives are valued; and (iv) growth, including the ability for\ncolleagues to gain new experiences that align with their individual career goals.\nIn 2022, we continued to maintain low turnover rates relative to the pharmaceutical industry and in our 2022 Pfizer Pulse survey, on average, 88% of colleagues reported feeling engaged,\nas measured by pride in working at Pfizer, willingness to recommend Pfizer as a great place to work and intent to stay.

Our Global Environment, Health & Safety (EHS) Policy and supporting standards outline our approach to assessment, evaluation, elimination, and mitigation\nof EHS risks across our operations globally. In 2022, we continued to carry out our COVID-19 pandemic preparedness and response procedures to help ensure on-site workers at all of our\nlocations globally remained safe and healthy. These precautions have been instrumental in protecting our workforce and helping ensure a continued supply of medicines and vaccines to\npatients. During 2022, we (i) continued to provide vaccinations for COVID-19 and other diseases to colleagues in countries where employer vaccination programs are permitted, (ii)\nbroadened our partnership with Thrive Global, a wellness and organizational change initiative with a primary focus on colleague mental health and wellness, (iii) provided educational\nwebinars and information sessions on mental health and well-being, nutrition and work life balance through our employee assistance program provider, including targeted support for our\ncolleagues in Russia and Ukraine, and (iv) shared wellness tips through the global Pfizer World intranet platform. In addition, as public health recommendations supported the return of\ncolleagues to office locations on a more regular basis, Pfizer ensured benefits and processes were in place to reinforce personal wellness and work life balance. For example, beginning in\n2023 we are implementing a new, flexible working model that enables work to be regularly conducted from home while maintaining regular on-site collaboration to provide greater flexibility\nfor many of our colleagues.\nPay Equity. Our commitment to pay equity for all colleagues is based in our value of Equity and our intention to continue to build a diverse and inclusive workforce.

The following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements, as discussed in the Forward-\nLooking Information and Factors that May Affect Future Results section in this Form 10-K.\nRISKS RELA TED T O OUR BUSINESS, INDUSTR Y AND OPERA TIONS:\nMANAGED CARE TRENDS\nPrivate payers, such as health plans, and other managed care entities, such as PBMs, continue to take action to manage the utilization and costs of drugs. The negotiating power of MCOs\nand other private third-party payers has increased due to consolidation, and they, along with governments, increasingly employ formularies to control costs and encourage utilization of\ncertain drugs, including through the use of formulary inclusion or favorable formulary placement. These initiatives have increased consumers\u2019 interest and input in medication choices, as\nthey pay for a larger portion of their prescription costs and may cause them to favor lower-cost generic alternatives. We may fail to obtain or maintain timely or adequate pricing or formulary\nplacement of our products, or fail to obtain such formulary placement at favorable pricing.\nThe growing availability and use of innovative specialty pharmaceutical medicines that treat rare or life-threatening conditions, which typically have smaller patient populations, combined\nwith their relative higher cost as compared to other types of pharmaceutical products, also has generated increased payer interest in developing cost-containment strategies targeted to this\nsector.\nThird-party payers also use additional measures such as new-to-market blocks, exclusion lists, indication-based pricing and value-based pricing/contracting to improve their cost\ncontainment efforts. Such payers are also increasingly imposing utilization management tools, such as clinical protocols, requiring prior authorization for a branded product if a generic\nproduct is available or requiring the patient to first fail on one or more generic products before permitting access to a branded medicine. As the U.S. private third-party payer market\nconsolidates further and as more drugs become available in generic form, we may face greater pricing pressure from private third-party payers as they continue to drive more of their\npatients to use lower cost generic alternatives.\nAlso, business arrangements in this area are subject to a high degree of government scrutiny, and available safe harbors under applicable federal and state fraud and abuse laws are\nsubject to change through legislative and regulatory action, as well as evolving judicial interpretations. Our approach to these arrangements may also be informed by such government and\nindustry guidance.\nCOMPETITIVE PRODUCTS\nCompetitive product launches may erode future sales of our products, including our existing products and those currently under development, or result in unanticipated product\nobsolescence. Such launches continue to occur, and potentially competitive products are in various stages of development. We cannot predict with accuracy the timing or impact of the\nintroduction of competitive products that treat or prevent diseases and conditions like those treated or prevented by our in-line products and product candidates.\nSome of our competitors may have competitive, technical or other advantages over us for the development of technologies and processes or greater experience in particular therapeutic\nareas, and consolidation among certain pharmaceutical and", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4328, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5a4ea229-b32a-4640-a5bc-ec3c163112fa": {"__data__": {"id_": "5a4ea229-b32a-4640-a5bc-ec3c163112fa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "21", "file_name": "pfizer_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "data\\pfizer_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf_part_20", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "21", "file_name": "pfizer_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "9131fa52fe2f038cd321a590b39b5cf1545bcfa30f68b014ae8f7bc0c8b2552b"}, "2": {"node_id": "d2f2eabe-1ae7-42ea-9403-7eab847fff48", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "21", "file_name": "pfizer_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "078d0e9761914d027e925b83b91ce5439a44a1a9bc6470e36f9d3dbbff7b101b"}}, "hash": "ac69467ee2f827ef7e82541dec0f392d0fe98142f77e82c0964804d8e67dfd1c", "text": "in particular therapeutic\nareas, and consolidation among certain pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can enhance such advantages. These advantages may make it difficult for us to compete with them\nsuccessfully to discover, develop and market new products and for our current products to compete with new products or indications they may bring to market. Our products have been\ncompeting and may continue to compete, and our product candidates may compete, against products or product candidates that offer higher rebates or discounts, lower prices, equivalent\nor superior efficacy, better safety profiles, easier administration, earlier market availability or other competitive features. If we are unable to compete effectively, this could reduce sales,\nwhich could negatively impact our results of operations.\nIn addition, competition from manufacturers of generic drugs, including from generic versions of competitors\u2019 branded products that lose their market exclusivity, is a major challenge for our\nbranded products. Certain of our products have experienced significant generic competition over the last few years. For additional information, see the Item 1. Business\u2014Patents and Other\nIntellectual Property Rights section in this Form 10-K. In China, we expect to continue to face intense competition by certain generic manufacturers, which have resulted, and may result in\nthe future, in price cuts and volume loss of some of our products.\nIn addition, our patented products may face generic or biosimilar competition before patent exclusivity expires, including from \u201cat-risk\u201d launch (despite pending patent infringement litigation\nagainst the generic or biosimilar product) by a manufacturer of a generic or biosimilar version of one of our patented products. Generic and biosimilar manufacturers have filed or could file\napplications with the FDA seeking approval of product candidates that they claim do not infringe our patents or claim that our patents are not valid. Our licensing and collaboration partners\nalso face challenges by generic drug manufacturers to patents covering products for which we have licenses or co-promotion rights.\nWe may become subject to competition from biosimilars referencing our biologic products if competitors are able to obtain marketing approval for such biosimilars.\nWe also commercialize biosimilar products that compete with products of others, including other biosimilar products. The entry to the market of competing biosimilars is expected to increase\npricing pressures on our biosimilar products. Uptake of our biosimilars may be lower due to various factors, such as anti-competitive practices, access challenges where our product may\nnot receive appropriate coverage/reimbursement access or remains in a disadvantaged position relative to an innovator product, physician reluctance to prescribe biosimilars for existing\npatients taking the innovative product, or misaligned financial incentives for certain prescribers.\nFor additional information on competition our products face, see the Item 1.

In particular, certain of our products have experienced patent-based expirations or loss of regulatory exclusivity in certain markets in the last few\nyears, and patents covering a number of our best-selling products are, or have been, the subject of pending legal challenges. For additional information on our patents, see the Item 1.\nBusiness\u2014Patents and Other Intellectual Property Rights section in this Form 10-K. For Comirnaty and Paxlovid, while we believe that these products have the potential to provide ongoing\nrevenue streams for Pfizer for the foreseeable future, revenues of these products following the COVID-19 pandemic may not be at similar levels as those generated during the pandemic.\nFor 2023, our revenue guidance for Comirnaty and Paxlovid as of January 31, 2023 is significantly lower than the 2022 revenues from these products. For information on risks associated\nwith Comirnaty and Paxlovid, see the COVID-19 section below.\nIn addition, we sell our prescription biopharmaceutical products, with the exception of Paxlovid, principally to wholesalers, but we also sell directly to retailers, hospitals, clinics, government\nagencies and pharmacies. In 2022, we principally sold Paxlovid to government agencies. We primarily sell our vaccines in the U.S. directly to the federal government, CDC, wholesalers,\nindividual provider offices, retail pharmacies and integrated delivery systems. Outside the U.S., we primarily sell our vaccines to government and non-government institutions. For additional\ninformation, see Note 17C. If one of our significant customers should encounter financial or other difficulties, it might decrease the amount of business such customer does with us and/or\nwe might be unable to timely collect all the amounts that such customer owes us or at all, which could negatively impact our results of operations. In addition, we expect that consolidation\nand integration of pharmacy chains and wholesalers will increase competitive and pricing pressures on pharmaceutical manufacturers, including us.\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\nThe discovery and development of new products, as well as the development of additional uses for existing products, are necessary for the continued strength of our business. Our product\nlines must be replenished over time to offset revenue losses when products lose exclusivity or market share or to respond to healthcare and innovation trends, as well as to provide for\nearnings growth, primarily through internal R&D or through collaborations, acquisitions, JVs, licensing or other arrangements. Growth depends in large part on our ability to identify and\ndevelop new products or new indications for existing products that address unmet medical needs and receive reimbursement from payers. However, balancing current growth, investment\nfor future growth and the delivery of shareholder return remains a major challenge.

We may fail to correctly identify\nindications for which our science is promising or allocate R&D investment resources efficiently, and failure to invest in the right technology platforms, therapeutic areas, product classes,\ngeographic markets and/or licensing opportunities could adversely impact the productivity of our pipeline. Further, even if we identify areas with the greatest commercial potential, the\nscientific approach may not succeed despite the significant investment required for R&D, and the product may not be as competitive as expected because of the highly dynamic market\nenvironment and the hurdles in terms of access and reimbursement. For example, our gene therapy product candidates are based on a novel technology with only a few gene therapies\napproved to date, which makes it difficult to predict the time and cost of development and the ability to obtain regulatory approval. Further, gene therapy may face difficulties in gaining the\nacceptance of patients or the medical community.\nGLOBAL OPERATIONS\nWe operate on a global scale and could be affected by currency fluctuations; capital and exchange controls; local and global economic conditions including inflation, recession, volatility\nand/or lack of liquidity in capital markets; expropriation and other restrictive government actions; changes in intellectual property; legal protections and remedies; trade regulations; tax laws\nand regulations; and procedures and actions affecting approval, production, pricing, and marketing of, reimbursement for and access to our products, as well as impacts of political or civil\nunrest or military action, including the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and its economic consequences, geopolitical instability, terrorist activity, unstable governments and legal\nsystems, inter-governmental disputes, public health outbreaks, epidemics, pandemics, natural disasters or disruptions related to climate change.\nSome emerging market countries may be particularly vulnerable to periods of financial or political instability or significant currency fluctuations or may have limited resources for healthcare\nspending.

In addition, we engage contract manufacturers, and, from time to time, our contract manufacturers may face difficulties or are unable to\nmanufacture our products at the necessary quantity or quality levels.\nRegulatory agencies periodically inspect our manufacturing facilities, as well as third-party facilities that we rely on, to evaluate compliance with cGMP or other applicable requirements.\nFailure to comply with these requirements may subject us to possible legal or regulatory actions, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product, injunctions,\ndebarment, product recalls, delays or denials of product approvals, import bans or denials of import certifications.\nIn 2021, Pfizer recalled all lots of Chantix in the U.S. due to the presence of a nitrosamine, N-nitroso-varenicline, at or above the FDA interim acceptable intake limit. We currently also have\na voluntary recall across multiple markets and a global pause in shipments of Chantix. Technical solutions are being pursued to reduce nitrosamine levels in Chantix to enable return to\nmarket. In response to requests from various regulatory authorities, manufacturers across the pharmaceutical industry, including Pfizer, are evaluating their product portfolios for the\npotential presence or formation of nitrosamines.

We rely heavily on these parties for multiple aspects of our drug development, manufacturing and commercialization activities, but we do not\ncontrol many aspects of those activities. We also outsource certain services, including activities related to transaction processing, accounting, IT, manufacturing, clinical trial recruitment and\nexecution, clinical lab services, non-clinical research, safety services, integrated facilities management and other areas.

Further, our Alliance\nrevenues will be adversely affected by the termination or expiration of collaboration and co-promotion agreements that we have entered into and that we may enter into from time to time.\nCOUNTERFEIT PRODUCTS\nOur reputation, in-line and pipeline portfolios render our medicines and vaccines prime targets for counterfeiters. Counterfeits pose a significant risk to patient health and safety because of\nthe conditions under which they are manufactured\u2014often in unregulated, unlicensed, uninspected, and unsanitary sites\u2014as well as the lack of regulation of their contents. Failure to\nmitigate this threat could adversely impact Pfizer\u2019s patients, potentially causing them harm. This situation, in turn, may result in the loss of patient confidence in the Pfizer name and in the\nintegrity of our medicines and vaccines, and potentially impact our business through lost sales, product recalls, and possible litigation.\nThe prevalence of counterfeit medicines is an industry-wide issue due to a variety of factors, including the adoption of e-commerce. The increased adoption during the COVID-19 pandemic\nfurther exposed consumers to fake prescription treatments via the internet as access to traditional brick and mortar pharmacies or authorized full-service internet pharmacies that offer\nauthentic treatments may have been hindered. The internet exposes patients to greater risk as it is a preferred vehicle for dangerous counterfeit offers and scams that target unsuspecting\nconsumers. Traffic to these generally deceptive pharmacy sites is largely driven by misplaced trust in sophisticated internet retailers and social media offers coupled with the convenience e-\ncommerce affords consumers.

The adoption of restrictive price controls in new jurisdictions,\nmore restrictive controls in existing jurisdictions or the failure to obtain or maintain timely or adequate pricing could also adversely impact revenue. We expect pricing pressures will continue\nglobally.\nIn the U.S., pharmaceutical product pricing is subject to government and public scrutiny and calls for reform, and many of our products are subject to increasing pricing pressures as a\nresult. We expect to see continued focus by the Federal government on regulating pricing which could result in legislative and regulatory changes designed to control costs. For example, in\nAugust 2022, the IRA was signed into law, which, among other things, requires manufacturers of certain drugs to engage in price negotiations with Medicare, imposes rebates under\nMedicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation, and replaces the Part D coverage gap discount program with a new discounting program. Some\nstates have implemented, and others are considering, patient access constraints or cost cutting under the Medicaid program, and some are considering measures that would apply to\nbroader segments of their populations that are not Medicaid-eligible. State legislatures also have continued to focus on addressing drug costs, generally by increasing price transparency or\nlimiting drug price increases. Measures to regulate prices or payment for pharmaceutical products, including legislation on drug importation, could adversely affect our business. For\nadditional information on U.S. pricing and reimbursement, see the Item 1. Business\u2014Government Regulation and Price Constraints section in this Form 10-K.\nWe encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most other countries in which we operate. In certain markets, such as in EU member states, the U.K., Japan, China, Canada and\nSouth Korea, governments have significant power as large single payers to regulate prices, access criteria, or impose other means of cost control, particularly as a result of recent global\nfinancing pressures. For example, the QCE and VBP tender process in China has resulted in significant price cuts for off-patent medicines. For additional information regarding these\ngovernment initiatives, see the Item 1. Business\u2014Government Regulation and Price Constraints section in this Form 10-K. We anticipate that these and similar initiatives will continue to\nincrease pricing pressures in China and elsewhere in the future. In addition, in many countries, with respect to our vaccines, we participate in a tender process for selection in national\nimmunization programs. Failure to secure participation in national immunization programs or to obtain acceptable pricing in the tender process could adversely affect our business. We also\nanticipate pricing pressures will be amplified by COVID-19 induced budget deficits and focus on pricing for COVID-19 treatments and vaccines.\nU.S. HEALTHCARE REGULATION\nThe U.S. healthcare industry is highly regulated and subject to frequent and substantial changes. Any significant efforts at the U.S. federal or state levels to reform the healthcare system by\nchanging the way healthcare is provided or funded could have a material impact on us. For additional information on U.S. healthcare regulation, see the Item 1.

The outcome is inherently uncertain and involves a high degree of\nrisk due to the following factors, among others:\n\u2022The process from early discovery to design and adequate implementation of clinical trials to regulatory approval can take many years.\n\u2022Product candidates can and do fail at any stage of the process, including as the result of unfavorable pre-clinical and clinical trial results, or unfavorable new pre-clinical or clinical data\nand further analyses of existing pre-clinical or clinical data, including results that may not support further clinical development of the product candidate or indication.\n\u2022We may need to amend our clinical trial protocols or conduct additional clinical trials under certain circumstances, for example, to further assess appropriate dosage or collect additional\nsafety data.\n\u2022We may not be able to meet anticipated pre-clinical or clinical endpoints, commencement and/or completion dates for our pre-clinical or clinical trials, regulatory submission dates,\nregulatory approval dates and/or launch dates.\n\u2022We may not be able to successfully address all the comments received from regulatory authorities such as the FDA and the EMA, or be able to obtain approval for new products and\nindications from regulators.\nRegulatory approvals of our products depend on myriad factors, including regulatory determinations as to the product\u2019s safety and efficacy. In the context of public health emergencies like\nthe COVID-19 pandemic, regulators evaluate various factors and criteria to potentially allow for marketing authorization on an emergency or conditional basis. Additionally, clinical trial and\nother product data are subject to differing interpretations and assessments by regulatory authorities. As a result of regulatory interpretations and assessments or other developments that\noccur during the review process, and even after a product is authorized or approved for marketing, a product\u2019s commercial potential could be adversely affected by potential emerging\nconcerns or regulatory decisions regarding or impacting labeling or marketing, manufacturing processes, safety and/or other matters, including decisions relating to emerging developments\nregarding potential product impurities.\nPfizer Inc. 2022 Form 10-K 17", "start_char_idx": 4083, "end_char_idx": 7702, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "03909d84-fd5e-432b-b0b9-82b85db1506a": {"__data__": {"id_": "03909d84-fd5e-432b-b0b9-82b85db1506a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "25", "file_name": "pfizer_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "data\\pfizer_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf_part_24", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "25", "file_name": "pfizer_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "941769c99d8831dd9482a56832c76681b64ce134c24f03aa1190e8b1777c3ec0"}, "3": {"node_id": "ca60a6f5-bc56-429e-90f2-c8b0c9362b33", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "25", "file_name": "pfizer_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "cb57c7baf6fabc0e85d3c362bd0a6d10f3782c6be3c02412f5cfeac465f4189b"}}, "hash": "3eac9b46276062990f0c085791ba2a843821e80544a69a1aae3eca8de9d6d09d", "text": "We may not be able to receive or maintain favorable recommendations by technical or advisory committees, such as the ACIP or any FDA Advisory Committee that may be convened to\nreview our applications such as EUAs, NDAs or BLAs, which may impact the potential marketing and use of our products. Further, claims and concerns that may arise regarding the safety\nand efficacy of in-line products and product candidates can negatively impact product sales, and potentially lead to product recalls or withdrawals, including regulator-directed risk\nevaluations and assessments, and/or consumer fraud, product liability and other litigation and claims. Further regulatory agency requirements may result in a more challenging, expensive\nand lengthy regulatory approval process than anticipated due to requests for, among other things, additional or more extensive clinical trials prior to granting approval, or increased post-\napproval requirements. For these and other reasons discussed in this Risk Factors section, we may not obtain the approvals we expect within the timeframe we anticipate, or at all.\nPOST-AUTHORIZATION/APPROVAL DATA\nAs a condition to granting marketing authorization or approval of a product, the FDA may require additional clinical trials or other studies. The results generated in these trials could result in\nthe loss of marketing approval, changes in labeling, and/or new or increased concerns about the side effects, efficacy or safety. Regulatory agencies in countries outside the U.S. often have\nsimilar regulations and may impose comparable requirements. Post-marketing studies and clinical trials, whether conducted by us or by others, whether mandated by regulatory agencies or\nconducted voluntarily, and other emerging data about products, such as adverse event reports, may also adversely affect the availability or commercial potential of our products. Further, if\nsafety or efficacy concerns are raised about a product in the same class as one of our products, those concerns could implicate the entire class; and this, in turn, could have an adverse\nimpact on the availability or commercial viability of our product(s) as well as other products in the class. The potential regulatory and commercial implications of post-marketing study results\ntypically cannot immediately be determined. For example, in December 2021, in light of the results from the completed required postmarketing safety study of Xeljanz, ORAL Surveillance\n(A3921133), the U.S. label for Xeljanz was revised. In addition, in November 2022, the EMA concluded their assessment of JAK inhibitors authorized for inflammatory diseases in the EU,\nincluding Xeljanz and Cibinqo, and recommended that risk minimization measures, including special warnings and precautions for use, should be revised and harmonized for all such JAK\ninhibitors. The resulting label changes are expected to be finalized in the first quarter of 2023. We continue to work with regulatory agencies worldwide to review the full results and analyses\nof ORAL Surveillance and their impact on product labeling.\nThe terms of our EUA for Comirnaty require that we conduct post-observational studies to evaluate the association between the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine, and Pfizer-BioNTech\nCOVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent, and a pre-specified list of adverse events of special interest, including myocarditis and pericarditis, along with deaths and hospitalizations, and severe COVID-\n19. The required study populations include individuals specified in our December 2022 authorization letter (reissued) as well as populations of interest, such as healthcare workers, pregnant\nwomen, immunocompromised individuals and subpopulations with specific comorbidities. Additionally, in relation to the FDA approval for Comirnaty, we are required to complete certain\npostmarketing study requirements and commitments through 2024 and beyond.

Litigation is inherently unpredictable, and excessive verdicts do occur. Although we\nbelieve that our claims and defenses in matters in which we are a defendant are substantial, we could in the future incur judgments, enter into settlements or revise our expectations\nregarding the outcome of certain matters, and such developments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nClaims against our patents include challenges to the coverage and/or validity of our patents on various products or processes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these\nmatters, and a loss in any of these cases could result in a loss of patent protection for the product at issue, which could lead to a significant loss of sales of that product and could materially\naffect future results of operations.\nWe are also involved in government investigations that arise in the ordinary course of our business. There continues to be a significant volume of government investigations and litigation\nagainst companies operating in our industry, both in the U.S. and around the world. Government investigations and actions could result in substantial criminal and civil fines and/or criminal\ncharges, limitations on our ability to conduct business in applicable jurisdictions, corporate integrity or deferred prosecution agreements and other disciplinary actions, as well as reputational\nharm, including as a result of increased public interest in the matter. In addition, in a qui tam lawsuit in which the government declines to intervene, the relator may still pursue a suit for the\nrecovery of civil damages and penalties on behalf of the government.\nOur sales and marketing activities, the pricing of our products and other aspects of our business are subject to extensive regulation under the FFDCA, the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program,\nthe FCPA and other federal and state statutes, including those discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-K, as well as the Anti-Kickback Statute, anti-bribery laws, the False Claims Act, and\nsimilar laws in international jurisdictions. In addition to the potential for changes to relevant laws, the compliance and enforcement landscape is informed by government litigation, settlement\nprecedent, advisory opinions, and special fraud alerts. Our approach to certain practices may evolve over time in light of these types of developments. Requirements or industry standards\nin the U.S. and certain jurisdictions abroad require pharmaceutical manufacturers to track and disclose financial interactions with healthcare professionals and healthcare providers and can\nincrease government and public scrutiny of such financial interactions. If an interaction is found to be improper, government enforcement actions and penalties could result.

The WTO continues to address the role of intellectual property in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic response. This\nincludes the June 2022 Ministerial Decision on the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, which seeks to make it easier for certain WTO members to issue a\ncompulsory license on COVID-19 vaccines, and discussions continue on whether to expand that decision to COVID-19 therapeutics and diagnostics.\nThe scope of our patent claims also may vary between countries, as individual countries have distinct patent laws, and our ability to enforce our patents depends on the laws of each\ncountry, its enforcement practices, and the extent to which certain countries engage in policies or practices that weaken a country\u2019s intellectual property framework (e.g., laws or regulations\nthat promote or provide broad discretion to issue a compulsory license). In countries that provide some form of regulatory exclusivity, mechanisms exist permitting some form of challenge to\nour patents by competitors or generic drug marketers prior to or immediately following the expiration of such regulatory exclusivity, and generic companies are employing aggressive\nstrategies, such as \u201cat risk\u201d launches that challenge our patent rights. Most of the suits involve claims by generic drug manufacturers that patents covering our products, uses, processes or\ndosage forms are invalid and/or do not cover the product of the generic or biosimilar drug manufacturer. Independent actions have been filed alleging that our assertions of, or attempts to\nenforce, patent rights with respect to certain products constitute unfair competition and/or violations of antitrust laws. Such claims may also be brought as counterclaims to actions we bring\nto enforce our patents. We are also party to other patent damages suits in various jurisdictions pursuant to which generic drug manufacturers, payers, governments or other parties are\nseeking damages", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4259, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2bc95521-d39f-4ba8-8cdf-cdabdb5362a3": {"__data__": {"id_": "2bc95521-d39f-4ba8-8cdf-cdabdb5362a3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "26", "file_name": "pfizer_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "data\\pfizer_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf_part_25", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "26", "file_name": "pfizer_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "9eb5e53edb088ebe85b3ac01adafa78a39239970b7b40ecc78e9183348f49dc6"}, "2": {"node_id": "d548948a-7343-4858-8bf7-d0afa3849885", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "26", "file_name": "pfizer_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "eec9d3be99bf5cf8e51fcd4a0fbebf17f722abdf9a2317174e4eaee3d7c8f6c4"}, "3": {"node_id": "f7ae7b17-47e2-4e37-b8cb-7ce6d248f758", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "26", "file_name": "pfizer_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "96d0a1f57986e3cd3d39f72126cd66477c0dba323cc70a27121b4112ef4a5f87"}}, "hash": "3be554d0b85d8b031c212d1e84b51a81a712b31af9353a06ed06bd836a1d1620", "text": "to which generic drug manufacturers, payers, governments or other parties are\nseeking damages from us for alleged delay of generic entry.

Also, if one of our patents or a competitors\u2019 patents is found to be invalid in such proceedings, generic or biosimilar products could be introduced into the market resulting in the\nerosion of sales of our existing products. For additional information, including information regarding certain legal proceedings in which we are involved, see Note 16A1. Further, if we are\nunable to maintain our existing license agreements or other agreements pursuant to which third parties grant us rights to intellectual property, our operating results and financial condition\ncould be adversely affected.\nWe currently hold trademark registrations and have trademark applications pending in many jurisdictions, any of which may be the subject of a governmental or third-party objection, which\ncould prevent the maintenance or issuance of the trademark. As our products mature, our reliance on our trademarks and trade dress to differentiate us from our competitors increases and,\nas a result, our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to prevent third parties from adopting, registering or using trademarks and trade dress that infringe, dilute or otherwise\nviolate our rights. We seek to protect our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and proprietary know-how, by requiring our employees, consultants, other advisors and other\nthird parties to execute proprietary information and confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their relationship with us. Despite these efforts and precautions, we may be\nunable to prevent a third-party from copying or otherwise obtaining and using our trade secrets or our other intellectual property without authorization, and legal remedies may not\nadequately compensate us for the damages caused by such unauthorized use. Further, others may independently and lawfully develop substantially similar or identical products that\ncircumvent our intellectual property by means of alternative designs or processes or otherwise.\nTHIRD-PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CLAIMS\nA properly functioning intellectual property regime is essential to our business model. We are committed to respecting the valid intellectual property rights of other companies, but the patent\ngranting process is imperfect. Accordingly, the pursuit of valid business opportunities may require us to challenge intellectual property rights held by others that we believe were improperly\ngranted, including challenges through negotiation and litigation, and such challenges may not always be successful.\nPart of our business depends upon identifying biosimilar opportunities and launching products to take advantage of those opportunities, which may involve litigation, associated costs and\ntime delays, and may ultimately not be successful. These opportunities may arise in situations where patent protection of equivalent branded products has expired or been declared invalid,\nor where products do not infringe the patents of others. In some circumstances we may take action, such as litigation, asserting that our products do not infringe patents of existing products\nor that those patents are invalid or unenforceable in order to achieve a \u201cfirst-to-market\u201d or early market position for our products.\nThird parties may claim that our products infringe one or more patents owned or controlled by them. Claims of intellectual property infringement can be costly and time-consuming to\nresolve, may delay or prevent product launches, and may result in significant royalty payments or damages or potential licensing agreements.

Such damages may be enhanced as much as three-fold if we or one\nof our subsidiaries is found to have willfully infringed valid patent rights of a third party.\nINFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND SECURITY\nSignificant disruptions of IT systems or breaches of information security could adversely affect our business. We extensively rely upon sophisticated IT systems (including cloud services) to\noperate our business. We produce, collect, process, store and transmit large amounts of confidential information (including personal information and intellectual property), and we deploy\nand operate an array of technical and procedural controls to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of such confidential information. The Company develops and operates\ndigital systems to engage patients, healthcare providers, governments, payers and supply chain partners to conduct business and deliver medicines, digital diagnostics, clinical trials and\ndigital therapies. Such systems include mobile applications, wearable devices, internet websites and other digital technologies that may be targets of attack. We have outsourced significant\nelements of our operations, including significant elements of our IT infrastructure and, as a result, we manage relationships with many third-party providers who may or could have access to\nour confidential information. We rely on technology developed, supplied and/or maintained by third-parties that may make us vulnerable to \u201csupply chain\u201d style cyber-attacks. Further,\ntechnology and security vulnerabilities of acquisitions, business partners or third-party providers may not be identified during due diligence or soon enough to mitigate exploitation. The size\nand complexity of our IT and information security systems, and those of our third-party providers (and the large amounts of confidential information that is present on them), make such\nsystems potentially vulnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by, but not limited to, our employees, contingent workers, service\nproviders, business partners, customers or malicious attackers. As a global pharmaceutical company, our systems and assets are the target of frequent cyber-attacks. Such cyber-attacks\nare of ever-increasing levels of sophistication and are made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives (including, but not limited to, industrial espionage, extortion, property\ndestruction and personal information theft) and expertise, including, but not limited to, organized criminal groups, \u201chacktivists,\u201d nation states, employees, business partners and others. Due\nto the nature of some of these attacks, there is a risk that they may remain undetected for a period of time. While we have invested in the protection of data and IT and develop and maintain\nsystems and controls, our efforts may not prevent service interruptions, extortion, theft of confidential, personal or proprietary information, compromise of data integrity or unauthorized\ninformation disclosure. Any technology service interruption or breach of our systems could adversely affect our business operations and/or result in the loss of personal data, confidential\ninformation or intellectual property. Such incidents could require disclosure to government authorities and/or regulators and could require notification to impacted individuals and any incident\ncould result in financial, legal, business and reputational harm to us. We maintain cyber liability insurance; however, this insurance may not be sufficient to cover the financial, legal,\nbusiness or reputational losses that may result from an interruption or breach of our systems.\nGENERAL  RISKS\nBUSINESS DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES\nOne enabler of our growth strategy is to expand our", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4274, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "27834610-6320-473b-8143-bc695d03e1f9": {"__data__": {"id_": "27834610-6320-473b-8143-bc695d03e1f9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "27", "file_name": "pfizer_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "data\\pfizer_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf_part_26", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "27", "file_name": "pfizer_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "68d6d222a82136ff533e310abb639a91165063be5009708ffa88feb5020bd2f5"}, "2": {"node_id": "f530ddbf-75ba-406c-863f-6201dc85967b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "27", "file_name": "pfizer_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "5d9ef06a9b7af2cef4acb00bf9ca10dee6c17e233b5e6e56b72eaabd0b12bd7a"}, "3": {"node_id": "7f5a1708-1c78-4edf-8c80-f3780f559b3e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "27", "file_name": "pfizer_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "9f825600769192ce918b2c0f3f89003d76f9c0139272867ae57ba8ff232fe76e"}}, "hash": "c44fb3d8e8bf36a43ee7bf5e911b378110d79957bc0f82f866db2cc4eddc63fe", "text": "ACTIVITIES\nOne enabler of our growth strategy is to expand our in-line products and product pipeline through various forms of business development, which can include alliances, licenses, JVs,\ncollaborations, equity- or debt-based investments, dispositions, divestments, mergers and acquisitions.

Pursuing, executing and consummating these transactions may require substantial investment, which may require us to obtain additional equity or debt\nfinancing, which could result in increased leverage and/or a downgrade of our credit ratings. The success of our business development transactions depends on our ability to realize the\nanticipated benefits of the transaction and is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control.

Transitional risks include, for example, a disorderly global transition away from fossil fuels that may result in\nincreased energy prices; customer preference for low or no-carbon products; stakeholder pressure to decarbonize assets; or new legal or regulatory requirements that result in new or\nexpanded carbon pricing, taxes, restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions, and increased greenhouse gas disclosure and transparency. These risks could increase operating costs,\nincluding the cost of our electricity and energy use, or other compliance costs. Physical risks to our operations include water stress and drought; flooding and storm surge; wildfires; extreme\ntemperatures and storms, which could impact pharmaceutical production, increase costs, or disrupt supply chains of medicines for patients. Our supply chain is likely subject to these same\ntransitional and physical risks and would likely pass along any increased costs to us. We do not anticipate that these risks will have a material financial impact to the company in the near\nterm.\nIn June 2022, Pfizer established our fourth consecutive greenhouse gas reduction goal with new near- and long-term targets to achieve the Science Based Target Initiative\u2019s voluntary Net-\nZero Standard by 2040. While we are working to develop emission reduction plans to achieve our voluntary climate goals, various factors, including the long time horizons and commercial\navailability of new technologies to enable the emission reductions, in the time and scale", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4141, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "afa5f3ff-05c5-474e-885c-10dcde90d86e": {"__data__": {"id_": "afa5f3ff-05c5-474e-885c-10dcde90d86e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "29", "file_name": "pfizer_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "data\\pfizer_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf_part_28", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "29", "file_name": "pfizer_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "48f473528bf3260a337e4f00aa2524c711a39d14dd5bde71d26dee4b5a8e93fb"}, "2": {"node_id": "3b7da964-6efc-48a3-928a-0bc5148f5706", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "29", "file_name": "pfizer_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "cc525f45a7f0536d3441fdf70d352acca667a9d7180d083bf2b9a360cc527b67"}}, "hash": "f2db8da608eb8a4a1ad90d05babd7a924b58ebd0ad73be07473d1f4bdec401e2", "text": "commercial\navailability of new technologies to enable the emission reductions, in the time and scale needed, may present inherent risk in our ability to meet these goals. Additionally, success may\ndepend on the actions of governments and third parties and may require, among other things, significant capital investment; research and development; and government policies and\nincentives to foster innovation and reduce costs of technologies that may not currently exist or be available at scale.\nGovernmental authorities, non-governmental organizations, customers, investors, employees, and other stakeholders are increasingly sensitive to ESG matters, such as equitable access to\nmedicines and vaccines, product quality and safety, diversity, equity and inclusion, environmental stewardship, support for local communities, value chain environmental and social due\ndiligence, corporate governance and transparency, and addressing human capital factors in our operations. In addition, governments and the public expect companies like us to report on\nour business practices with respect to human rights, responsible sourcing and environmental impact, as well as the actions of our third-party contractors and suppliers around the world.\nThis focus on ESG matters may lead to new expectations or requirements that could result in increased costs associated with research, development, manufacture, or distribution of our\nproducts. Our ability to compete could also be affected by changing customer preferences and requirements, such as growing demand for companies to establish validated Net Zero targets\nor offer more sustainable products. While we strive to improve our ESG performance and meet our voluntary goals, if we do not meet, or are perceived not to meet, our goals or other\nstakeholder expectations in key ESG areas, we risk negative stakeholder reaction, including from proxy advisory services, as well as damage to our brand and reputation, reduced demand\nfor our products or other negative impacts on our business and operations. While we monitor a broad range of ESG matters, we cannot be certain that we will manage such matters\nsuccessfully, or that we will successfully meet the expectations of investors, employees, consumers, governments and other stakeholders.\nMARKET FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR EQUITY AND OTHER INVESTMENTS\nChanges in the fair value of certain equity investments need to be recognized in net income that may result in increased volatility of our income. For additional information, see Note 4 and\nthe Analysis of Financial Condition, Liquidity, Capital Resources and Market Risk section within MD&A.\nOur pension benefit obligations and postretirement benefit obligations are subject to volatility from changes in the fair value of equity investments and other investment risk in the assets\nfunding these plans.

Such risks and\nuncertainties include, in particular, our ability to realize the projected benefits of our cost-reduction and productivity initiatives, other corporate strategic initiatives and any acquisitions,\ndivestitures or other initiatives, as well as potential disruption of ongoing business.\nINTANGIBLE ASSETS, GOODWILL AND EQUITY-METHOD INVESTMENTS\nOur consolidated balance sheet contains significant amounts of intangible assets, including IPR&D and goodwill. For IPR&D assets, the risk of failure is significant, and there can be no\ncertainty that these assets ultimately will yield successful products. Our ability to realize value on these significant investments is often contingent upon, among other things, regulatory\napprovals and market acceptance. As such, IPR&D assets may become impaired and/or be written off in the future if the associated R&D effort is abandoned or is curtailed. For goodwill, all\nreporting units can confront events and circumstances that can lead to a goodwill impairment charge such as, among other things, unanticipated competition, an adverse action or\nassessment by a regulator, a significant adverse change in legal matters or in the business climate and/or a failure to replace the contributions of products that lose exclusivity. Our other\nintangible assets, including developed technology rights and brands, face similar risks for impairment. Our equity-method investments may also be subject to impairment charges that may\nresult from the occurrence of unexpected adverse events or management decisions that impact our estimates of expected cash flows to be generated from these investments. We may\nrecognize impairment charges as a result of a weak economic environment, events related to particular customers or asset types, challenging market conditions or decisions by\nmanagement. Any such impairment charge of our intangible assets, goodwill and equity-method investments may be significant.

We apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend\nand significantly improve their lives. See the Item 1. Business\u2013\u2013About Pfizer section in this Form 10-K. Pfizer is committed to working towards equitable and affordable access to our\nmedicines and vaccines for people around the world. As a science-driven global biopharmaceutical company, we remain focused on advancing our pipeline, supporting our marketed brands\nand deploying capital responsibly, with a focus on initiatives that can help contribute to our long-term revenue and future growth. Our ability to fulfill our purpose, Breakthroughs that change\npatients\u2019 lives, remains a core focus and underscores our commitment to addressing the needs of society to help sustain long-term value creation for all stakeholders. Most of our revenues\ncome from the manufacture and sale of biopharmaceutical products. We believe that our medicines and vaccines provide significant value for healthcare providers and patients and seek to\nenhance their value by continuously evaluating how we can best collaborate with patients, physicians and payers to support and expand patient access to reliable, affordable healthcare\naround the world. In addition, we continually seek to expand and broaden our product portfolio offerings through prioritized development of our pipeline and acquisitions targeted at critical\nunmet patient needs. As a result, our commercial organizational structure and R&D operations are critical to the successful execution of our business strategy. In 2023, we are making\nadditional investments in both R&D and SI&A to support Pfizer\u2019s near- and longer-term growth plans, including to support anticipated new launches, commercial launch of COVID-19\nproducts, potential high-value pipeline programs and recently acquired assets.\nWith the formation of the Consumer Healthcare JV in 2019, the spin-off of our former Upjohn Business in the fourth quarter of 2020 and the sale of our Meridian subsidiary in the fourth\nquarter of 2021, Pfizer transformed into a more focused, global leader in science-based innovative medicines and vaccines engaged in the discovery, development, manufacture, marketing,\nsale and distribution of biopharmaceutical products worldwide. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we began managing our commercial operations through a global structure consisting of two\noperating segments: Biopharma and PC1. Biopharma is the only reportable segment. See Note 1A and Item 1. Business\u2013\u2013Commercial Operations in this Form 10-K for additional\ninformation.

These include, among others, the topics listed below. See\nalso the Item 1. Business\u2013\u2013Government Regulation and Price Constraints and Item 1A. Risk Factors sections in this Form 10-K.\nRegulatory Environment\u2013\u2013Pipeline Productivity\u2013\u2013Our product lines must be replenished over time to offset revenue losses when products lose exclusivity or market share or to respond to\nhealthcare and innovation trends, as well as to provide for earnings growth. As a result, we devote considerable resources to our R&D activities which, while essential to our growth,\nincorporate a high degree of risk and cost, including whether a particular product candidate or new indication for an in-line product will achieve the desired clinical endpoint or safety profile,\nwill be approved by regulators or will be successful commercially. Clinical trials are conducted to determine, among other things, whether an investigational drug or device is safe and\neffective for a particular patient population. After a product has been approved or authorized and launched, we continue to monitor its safety as long as it is available to patients, including\nconducting postmarketing trials, voluntarily or pursuant to a regulatory request. For the entire life of the product, we collect safety data and report safety information to the FDA and other\nregulators. Regulatory authorities evaluate potential safety concerns and take any regulatory action deemed necessary and appropriate. Such action(s) may include: updating a product\u2019s\nlabeling, restricting its use, communicating new safety information or, in rare cases, seeking to suspend or remove a product from the market.\nIntellectual Property Rights and Collaboration/Licensing Rights\u2013\u2013The loss, expiration or invalidation of intellectual property rights, patent litigation settlements and the expiration of co-\npromotion and licensing rights can have a material adverse effect on our revenues. Certain of our products have experienced patent-based expirations or loss of regulatory exclusivity in\ncertain markets in the last few years, and we expect certain products to face increased generic competition over the next few years. While additional patent expiries will continue, we expect\na moderate impact of reduced revenues due to patent expiries from 2023 through 2025. We anticipate a more significant impact of reduced revenues from patent expiries in 2026 through\n2030 as several of our in-line products experience patent-based expirations. We continue to vigorously defend our patent rights against infringement, and we will continue to support efforts\nthat strengthen worldwide recognition of patent rights while taking necessary steps to help ensure appropriate patient access.\nFor additional information on patent rights we consider most significant to our business as a whole, see the Item 1.

Federal and\nstate governments and private third-party payers in the U.S. continue to take action to manage the utilization of drugs and cost of drugs, including increasingly employing formularies to\ncontrol costs by taking into account discounts in connection with decisions about formulary inclusion or favorable formulary placement. We consider a number of factors impacting the\npricing of our medicines and vaccines. Within the U.S., we often engage with patients, doctors and healthcare plans. We also often provide significant discounts from the list price to\ninsurers, including PBMs and MCOs. The price that patients pay in the U.S. for prescribed medicines and vaccines is ultimately set by healthcare providers and insurers.

Governments\nglobally, as well as private third-party payers in the U.S., may use a variety of measures to control costs, including, among others, proposing pricing reform or legislation, employing\nformularies to control costs, cross country collaboration and procurement, price cuts, mandatory rebates, health technology assessments, forced localization as a condition of market\naccess, \u201cinternational reference pricing\u201d (i.e., the practice of a country linking its regulated medicine prices to those of other countries), QCE processes and VBP. We anticipate that these\nand similar initiatives will continue to increase pricing and access pressures globally. In the U.S., we expect to see continued focus by Congress and the Biden Administration on regulating\npricing, which could result in legislative and regulatory changes designed to control costs, such as the IRA that was signed into law in August 2022. We continue to evaluate the impact of\nthe IRA on our business, operations and financial condition and results as the full effect of the IRA on our business and the pharmaceutical industry remains uncertain. In addition, changes\nto the Medicaid program or the federal 340B drug pricing program, including legal or legislative developments at the federal or state level with respect to the 340B program, could have a\nmaterial impact on our business.

In response to requests from various regulatory authorities,\nmanufacturers across the pharmaceutical industry, including Pfizer, are evaluating their product portfolios for the potential presence or formation of nitrosamines. This has led to recalls,\nincluding our voluntary recall of Chantix in 2021 and additional voluntary recalls initiated for other products in 2022 due to the presence of nitrosamines above the FDA interim acceptable\nintake limit, and may lead to additional recalls or other market actions for Pfizer products.\nRegarding our supply chain generally, in 2022 and to date, we have not seen a significant disruption, and all of our manufacturing sites globally have continued to operate at or near normal\nlevels; however, we are seeing an increase in overall demand in the industry for certain components and raw materials, which could potentially result in constraining available supply leading\nto a possible future impact on our business. We are continuing to monitor and implement mitigation strategies in an effort to reduce any potential risk or impact including active supplier\nmanagement, qualification of additional suppliers and advanced purchasing to the extent possible.

This includes continuing to evaluate Comirnaty and Paxlovid, including against new variants of concern, developing\nmonovalent, bivalent and variant adapted vaccine candidates and booster doses and developing potential combination respiratory vaccines and potential next generation vaccines and\ntherapies. We are also evaluating Paxlovid for additional populations. For additional information, including our continuing late-stage development efforts for Paxlovid, see the Product\nDevelopments section within MD&A.\nIn 2022 and to date, we principally sold Comirnaty and Paxlovid globally under government contracts. We expect sales of Comirnaty in the U.S. will transition to traditional commercial\nmarket sales in the second half of 2023, triggered by the expiration of current contracts and the vaccines purchased through them becoming either depleted or not usable against new\nvariants. Internationally, we expect sales of Comirnaty in international developed markets to generally be under government contracts in 2023, and in emerging markets, under a\ncombination of private channels and government contracts; in both cases, we expect to generally transition to commercial markets starting in 2024. For Paxlovid, we expect 2023 to be a\ntransitional year as we expect to start selling Paxlovid through the commercial channels in the second half of 2023 rather than significant government purchases. We also remain committed\nto helping ensure broad and equitable access to our COVID-19 products to eligible patients around the world. Revenues from our COVID-19 products are expected to go from their peak in\n2022 to their low point in 2023 before potentially returning to growth in 2024. While patient demand for our COVID-19 products is expected to remain strong throughout 2023, much of that\ndemand is expected to be fulfilled by existing supply of products that were delivered to governments and recorded as revenues in 2022. As of January 31, 2023, we forecasted Comirnaty\nrevenues of approximately $13.5 billion in 2023, down 64% from actual 2022 results, with gross profit to be split evenly with BioNTech, and Paxlovid revenues of approximately $8 billion in\n2023, down 58% from actual 2022 results. Guidance for both products includes, among other things, anticipated sales through traditional commercial markets in the U.S. in the second half\nof 2023 and assumes prior absorption of existing government supply from advanced purchase agreements from 2022. These forecasts are based on estimates and assumptions that are\nsubject to significant uncertainties, including, among others, patient demand which could be significantly impacted by the infectiousness and severity of the predominant strains of the SAR-\nCoV-2 virus during 2023, proportion of the population that receives a vaccine or is treated with an oral antiviral treatment, the number of doses per vaccinated person per year, number of\nsymptomatic infections, market share of Comirnaty and Paxlovid, timing and terms for delivery of the contracted doses of Comirnaty to the EC, Paxlovid sales to China and the timing for\ntransitioning Comirnaty and Paxlovid sales to the commercial market in the U.S.\nIn addition to our introduction of Comirnaty and Paxlovid, COVID-19 has impacted our business, operations and financial condition and results. For example, COVID-19 had varying impacts\non patient visits, vaccinations, elective surgeries, cancer screenings and routine testing, which affected prescriptions or refills of existing prescriptions and demand for products used in\nprocedures. As part of our on-going monitoring and assessment, we have made certain assumptions regarding COVID-19 for purposes of our operational planning and financial projections,\nincluding assumptions regarding the global macroeconomic impact of COVID-19, as well as the demand, revenues, supply, contracts and commercial markets for our COVID-19 products,\nwhich remain dynamic.

Consistent with our commitment to putting patients first, we are\nmaintaining the supply of medicines to Russia, including the provision of needed medicines to patients already enrolled in clinical trials. Effective March 14, 2022, Pfizer began donating\nprofits of our Russian subsidiary to causes that provide direct humanitarian support to the people of Ukraine, in addition to our ongoing efforts to support the humanitarian response in the\nregion. In 2022, we have donated approximately $25 million to support humanitarian relief and response efforts. We will continue to support Ukrainian relief efforts through this method until\npeace is achieved. Additionally, we are not initiating new clinical trials in Russia, have stopped recruiting new patients in our ongoing clinical trials in the country, and halted all new\ninvestments with local suppliers intended to build manufacturing capacity in Russia. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the business of our Russia and Ukraine subsidiaries\nrepresented less than 1% of our consolidated revenues and assets, and while we are monitoring the effects of the armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the situation continues to\nevolve and the long-term implications, including the broader economic consequences of the conflict, are difficult to predict at this time. While as of now, we do not anticipate any significant\nnegative impacts on our business from this conflict, continued regional instability, geopolitical shifts, potential additional sanctions and other restrictive measures against Russia, neighboring\ncountries or allies of Russia, any retaliatory measures taken by Russia, neighboring countries or allies of Russia, and actions by our customers or suppliers in response to such measures\ncould adversely affect the global macroeconomic environment, our operations, currency exchange rates and financial markets, which could in turn adversely impact our business and results\nof operations.\nSIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND APPLICA TION OF CRITICAL  ACCOUNTING ESTIMA TES AND ASSUMPTIONS\nFollowing is a discussion about the critical accounting estimates and assumptions impacting our consolidated financial statements. Also, see Note 1C.\nFor a description of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1.

For further\ninformation on our process to estimate the fair value of intangible assets, see Asset Impairments below. We estimate the fair value of acquired inventory, including finished goods and work\nin process, by determining the estimated selling price when completed, less an estimate of costs to be incurred to complete and sell the inventory, and an estimate of a reasonable profit\nallowance for those manufacturing and selling efforts. The fair value of inventory is recognized in our results of operations as the inventory is sold. Some of the more significant estimates\nand assumptions inherent in the estimate of the fair value of inventory include stage of completion, costs to complete, costs to dispose and selling price.\nRevenues\nOur gross product revenues are subject to a variety of deductions, which generally are estimated and recorded in the same period that the revenues are recognized. Such variable\nconsideration represents chargebacks, rebates, sales allowances and sales returns. These deductions represent estimates of the related obligations and, as such, knowledge and judgment\nare required when estimating the impact of these revenue deductions on gross sales for a reporting period. Historically, adjustments to these estimates to reflect actual results or updated\nexpectations, have not been material to our overall business and generally have been less than 1% of revenues. Product-specific rebates, however, can have a significant impact on year-\nover-year individual product revenue growth trends. If any of our ratios, factors, assessments, experiences or judgments are not indicative or accurate estimates of our future experience,\nour results could be materially affected. The potential of our estimates to vary (sensitivity) differs by program, product, type of customer and geographic location. However, estimates\nassociated with U.S. Medicare, Medicaid and performance-based contract rebates are most at risk for material adjustment because of the extensive time delay between the recording of the\naccrual and its ultimate settlement, an interval that can generally range up to one year. Because of this lag, our recording of adjustments to reflect actual amounts can incorporate revisions\nof several prior quarters. Rebate accruals are product specific and, therefore for any period, are impacted by the mix of products sold as well as the forecasted channel mix for each\nindividual product. For further information, see the Revenue Deductions section within MD&A and Note 1G.\nAsset Impairments\nWe review all of our long-lived assets for impairment indicators throughout the year. We perform impairment testing for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill at least annually and for\nall other long-lived assets whenever impairment indicators are present. When necessary, we record charges for impairments of long-lived assets for the amount by which the fair value is\nless than the carrying value of these assets. Our impairment review processes are described in Note 1M.\nExamples of events or circumstances that may be indicative of impairment include:\n\u2022A significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of the asset. For example, a successful challenge of our patent rights would likely result\nin generic competition earlier than expected.\n\u2022A significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used such as a restriction imposed by the FDA or other regulatory authorities that could affect our ability to\nmanufacture or sell a product.\n\u2022An expectation of losses or reduced profits associated with an asset. This could result, for example, from a change in a government reimbursement program that results in an inability to\nsustain projected product revenues and profitability. This also could result from the introduction of a competitor\u2019s product that impacts projected revenue growth, as well as the lack of\nacceptance of a product by patients, physicians and payers.

We start with\na forecast of all the expected net cash flows associated with the asset, which incorporates the consideration of a terminal value for indefinite-lived assets, and then we apply an asset-\nspecific discount rate to arrive at a net present value amount. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions that impact our fair value estimates include: the amount and timing of\nthe projected net cash flows, which includes the expected impact of competitive, legal and/or regulatory forces on the projections and the impact of technological advancements and risk\nassociated with IPR&D assets, as well as the selection of a long-term growth rate; the discount rate, which seeks to reflect the various risks inherent in the projected cash flows; and the tax\nrate, which seeks to incorporate the jurisdictional mix of the projected cash flows.\nWhile all intangible assets other than goodwill can face events and circumstances that can lead to impairment, those that are most at risk of impairment include IPR&D assets\n(approximately $11.4 billion as of December 31, 2022) and newly acquired or recently impaired indefinite-lived brand assets. IPR&D assets are high-risk assets, given the uncertain nature\nof R&D. Newly acquired and recently impaired indefinite-lived assets are more vulnerable to impairment as the assets are recorded at fair value and are then subsequently measured at the\nlower of fair value or carrying value at the end of each reporting period. As such, immediately after acquisition or impairment, even small declines in the outlook for these assets can\nnegatively impact our ability to recover the carrying value and can result in an impairment charge.\nGoodwill\u2013\u2013Our goodwill impairment review work as of December 31, 2022 concluded that none of our goodwill was impaired and we do not believe the risk of impairment is significant at\nthis time, as the fair value of each of our reporting units is significantly higher than their respective net book values.\nIn our review, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Qualitative factors that we\nconsider include, for example, macroeconomic and industry conditions, overall financial performance and other relevant entity-specific events. If we conclude that it is more likely than not\nthat the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we then perform a quantitative fair value test.\nWhen we are required to determine the fair value of a reporting unit, we typically use the income approach. The income approach is a forward-looking approach to estimating fair value and\nrelies primarily on internal forecasts. Within the income approach, we use the discounted cash flow method. We start with a forecast of all the expected net cash flows for the reporting unit,\nwhich includes the application of a terminal value, and then we apply a reporting unit-specific discount rate to arrive at a net present value amount. Some of the more significant estimates\nand assumptions inherent in this approach include: the amount and timing of the projected net cash flows, which includes the expected impact of technological risk and competitive, legal\nand/or regulatory forces on the projections, as well as the selection of a long-term growth rate; the discount rate, which seeks to reflect the various risks inherent in the projected cash flows;\nand the tax rate, which seeks to incorporate the geographic diversity of the projected cash flows.\nPfizer Inc. 2022 Form 10-K 30", "start_char_idx": 4222, "end_char_idx": 8123, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "10bde388-a080-4ad2-9c07-75b73f00cb57": {"__data__": {"id_": "10bde388-a080-4ad2-9c07-75b73f00cb57", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "38", "file_name": "pfizer_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "data\\pfizer_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf_part_37", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "38", "file_name": "pfizer_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "881054e646ef5aa1e7355cd42f151f176b99c28da621cc8b586de300b593ba4f"}, "3": {"node_id": "03c249ba-7235-4a9b-bed6-da5bf0510a08", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "38", "file_name": "pfizer_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "0561c360e790c41c6e2166b7556d9da10ba673932eda44f3d3263d17fb1f3e4b"}}, "hash": "c3b484fc4d42b02d057bef33bdc84bea85af7afcdcf9755289f963e3b63d74dd", "text": "For all of our reporting units, there are a number of future events and factors that may impact future results and that could potentially have an impact on the outcome of subsequent goodwill\nimpairment testing.

Additionally,\nthe payout for performance share awards is determined in part by Adjusted net income, which is derived from Adjusted income. Beginning in the first quarter of 2022, we no longer exclude any expenses for\nacquired IPR&D from our non-GAAP Adjusted results but we continue to exclude certain of these expenses for our financial results for annual incentive compensation purposes. The bonus pool funding, which is\nlargely based on financial performance, is adjusted by our R&D pipeline performance, as measured by four metrics, and performance against certain of our ESG metrics, and may be further modified by our\nCompensation Committee\u2019s assessment of other factors.\nAdjusted income and its components and Adjusted diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures that have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and, therefore, are limited in\ntheir usefulness to investors. Because of their non-standardized definitions, they may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies and are presented to\npermit investors to more fully understand how management assesses performance. A limitation of these measures is that they provide a view of our operations without including all events\nduring a period, and do not provide a comparable view of our performance to peers.

We\nalso use other tools designed to achieve the highest levels of performance. For example, our R&D organization has productivity targets, upon which its effectiveness is measured. In\naddition, total shareholder return, both on an absolute basis and relative to a publicly traded pharmaceutical index, plays a significant role in determining payouts under certain of our\nincentive compensation plans.\nBeginning in the first quarter of 2022, our reconciliation of certain GAAP Reported to non-GAAP Adjusted information is updated to reflect the following, and prior-period information has\nbeen revised to conform to the current period presentation:\nAdjusted Income and Adjusted Diluted EPS\nAcquired IPR&D\u2014Non-GAAP Adjusted financial measures include expenses for all acquired IPR&D costs incurred in connection with upfront and milestone payments on collaboration and\nin-license agreements, including premiums on equity securities, as well as asset acquisitions of acquired IPR&D. Previously, certain of these items were excluded from our non-GAAP\nAdjusted results. Acquired IPR&D expenses that previously would have been excluded from non-GAAP Adjusted income but are now included in both GAAP Reported income and non-\nGAAP Adjusted income were approximately: (i) $765 million pre-tax ($665 million, net of tax), or $0.12 per share, in 2022; (ii) $3.3 billion pre-tax ($2.6 billion, net of tax), or $0.45 per share,\nin 2021; and (iii) $504 million pre-tax ($397 million, net of tax), or $0.07 per share, in 2020.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\u2014We began excluding all amortization of intangibles from non-GAAP Adjusted income, compared to excluding only amortization of intangibles related to\nlarge mergers or acquisitions under the prior methodology, and presenting it as a separate reconciling line. Previously, the adjustment under the prior methodology was included as part of a\nreconciling line entitled \u201cPurchase accounting adjustments\u201d that we no longer separately present. The impact of this policy change resulted in benefits on Adjusted diluted EPS of $0.06 in\n2022, $0.09 in 2021 and $0.05 in 2020.\nAcquisition-Related Items\u2013\u2013Adjusted income continues to exclude certain acquisition-related items, which are comprised of transaction, integration, restructuring charges and additional\ndepreciation costs for business combinations because these costs are unique to each(a)\n(b) (a)\n(a)\n(a)\n(b)\nPfizer Inc. 2022 Form 10-K 39", "start_char_idx": 4089, "end_char_idx": 6775, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f1522675-94f6-4e45-80b8-e739e2e08f0c": {"__data__": {"id_": "f1522675-94f6-4e45-80b8-e739e2e08f0c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "47", "file_name": "pfizer_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "data\\pfizer_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf_part_46", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "47", "file_name": "pfizer_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "e1c94e279c9b0a170b9b8cd2740b19915cd2cfb0ad1819ee3d1406b009f0f880"}, "3": {"node_id": "f250957e-8ea8-46af-b18d-248e798d9e3e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "47", "file_name": "pfizer_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "b53233b23ede520e62f43e425c0fd5cc101fbff5fb21660906d555982e5f7259"}}, "hash": "6b81d5a82c7d5408ab31e0a56b54ffd9e797795eebf63de10b906b26eeb6a583", "text": "transaction and represent costs that were incurred to restructure and integrate businesses as a result of an acquisition. We have made no adjustments for resulting synergies.\nThe significant costs incurred in connection with a business combination result primarily from the need to eliminate duplicate assets, activities or employees\u2013\u2013a natural result of acquiring a\nfully integrated set of activities. For this reason, we believe that such costs incurred can be viewed differently in the context of an acquisition from those costs incurred in other, more normal,\nbusiness contexts. The integration and restructuring costs for a business combination may occur over several years, with the more significant impacts typically ending within three years of\nthe relevant transaction. Because of the need for certain external approvals for some actions, the span of time needed to achieve certain restructuring and integration activities can be\nlengthy.\nAcquisition-related items may now include purchase accounting impacts that previously would have been included as part of a reconciling line entitled \u201cPurchase accounting adjustments\u201d\nthat we no longer separately present, such as: (i) the incremental charge to cost of sales from the sale of acquired inventory that was written up to fair value; (ii) depreciation related to the\nincrease/decrease in fair value of acquired fixed assets; (iii) amortization related to the increase in fair value of acquired debt and (iv) the fair value changes for contingent consideration.\nDiscontinued Operations\u2013\u2013Adjusted income continues to exclude the results of discontinued operations, as well as any related gains or losses on the disposal of such operations. We\nbelieve that this presentation is meaningful to investors because, while we review our product portfolio for strategic fit with our operations, we do not build or run our business with the intent\nto discontinue parts of our business. Restatements due to discontinued operations do not impact compensation or change the Adjusted income measure for the compensation in respect of\nthe restated periods, but are presented for consistency across all periods.\nCertain Significant Items\u2013\u2013Adjusted income continues to exclude certain significant items representing substantive and/or unusual items that are evaluated individually on a quantitative and\nqualitative basis. Certain significant items may be highly variable and difficult to predict. Furthermore, in some cases it is reasonably possible that they could reoccur in future periods. For\nexample, although major non-acquisition-related cost-reduction programs are specific to an event or goal with a defined term, we may have subsequent programs based on reorganizations\nof the business, cost productivity or in response to LOE or economic conditions. Legal charges to resolve litigation are also related to specific cases, which are facts and circumstances\nspecific and, in some cases, may also be the result of litigation matters at acquired companies that were inestimable, not probable or unresolved at the date of acquisition, or legal matters\nrelated to divested products or businesses. Gains and losses on equity securities, and pension and postretirement actuarial remeasurement gains and losses have a very high degree of\ninherent market volatility, which we do not control and cannot predict with any level of certainty and because we do not believe including these gains and losses assists investors in\nunderstanding our business or is reflective of our core operations and business. Unusual items represent items that are not part of our ongoing business; items that, either as a result of their\nnature or size, we would not expect to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis; items that would be non-recurring; or items that relate to products we no longer sell.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders\nPfizer Inc.:\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Pfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated\nstatements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively, the\nconsolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31,\n2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted\naccounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company\u2019s internal control over financial\nreporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission, and our report dated February 23, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements\nbased on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal\nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether\nthe consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material\nmisstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a\ntest basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant\nestimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our\nopinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be\ncommunicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially\nchallenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a\nwhole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nEvaluation of the U.S. Medicare, Medicaid, and performance-based contract rebates accrual\nAs discussed in Note 1G to the consolidated financial statements, the Company records estimated deductions for Medicare, Medicaid, and performance-based contract rebates\n(collectively, U.S. rebates) as a reduction to gross product revenues. The accrual for U.S. rebates is recorded in the same period that the corresponding revenues are recognized.

The\nlength of time between when a sale is made and when the U.S. rebate is paid by the Company can be as long as one year, which increases the need for significant management\njudgment and knowledge of market conditions and practices in estimating the accrual.\nWe identified the evaluation of the U.S. rebates accrual as a critical audit matter because the evaluation of the product-specific experience ratio assumption involved especially\nchallenging auditor judgment. The product-specific experience ratio assumption relates to estimating which of the Company\u2019s revenue transactions will ultimately be subject to a related\nrebate.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls\nover the Company\u2019s U.S. rebates accrual process related to the development of the product-specific experience ratio assumptions. We estimated the U.S. rebates accrual using internal\ninformation and historical data and compared the result to the Company\u2019s estimated U.S. rebates accrual. We evaluated the Company\u2019s ability to accurately estimate the accrual for U.S.\nrebates by comparing historically recorded accruals to the actual amount that was ultimately paid by the Company.\nEvaluation of gross unrecognized tax benefits\nAs discussed in Notes 5D and 1Q, the Company\u2019s tax positions are subject to audit by local taxing authorities in each respective tax jurisdiction, and the resolution of such audits may\nspan multiple years. Since tax law is complex and often subject to varied interpretations and judgments, it is uncertain whether some of the Company\u2019s tax positions will be sustained\nupon audit. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has recorded gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding associated interest, of $4.5 billion.\nWe identified the evaluation of certain of the Company\u2019s gross unrecognized tax benefits as a critical audit matter because a high degree of audit effort, including specialized skills and\nknowledge, and complex auditor judgment was required in evaluating the Company\u2019s interpretation of tax law and its estimate of the ultimate resolution of its tax positions.\nPfizer Inc. 2022 Form 10-K 45", "start_char_idx": 4052, "end_char_idx": 6312, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8e2c34e1-80b3-420f-8fc4-6f7ba0b87e0f": {"__data__": {"id_": "8e2c34e1-80b3-420f-8fc4-6f7ba0b87e0f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "53", "file_name": "pfizer_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "data\\pfizer_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf_part_52", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "53", "file_name": "pfizer_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "68cf7bc94aa22391038526b999f041c3e88419bdace37fafa5d1424a91b3068d"}}, "hash": "68cf7bc94aa22391038526b999f041c3e88419bdace37fafa5d1424a91b3068d", "text": "Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of an internal control over the\nCompany\u2019s liability for unrecognized tax position process related to (1) interpretation of tax law, (2) evaluation of which of the Company\u2019s tax positions may not be sustained upon audit,\nand (3) estimation and recording of the gross unrecognized tax benefits. We involved tax and valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge who assisted in evaluating the\nCompany\u2019s interpretation of tax laws, including the assessment of transfer pricing practices in accordance with applicable tax laws and regulations. We inspected settlements with\napplicable taxing authorities, including assessing the expiration of statutes of limitations. We tested the calculation of the liability for uncertain tax positions, including an evaluation of the\nCompany\u2019s assessment of the technical merits of tax positions and estimates of the amount of tax benefits expected to be sustained.\nEvaluation of product liability and other product-related litigation\nAs discussed in Notes 1S. and 16 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company is involved in product liability and other product-related litigation, which can include personal\ninjury, consumer, off-label promotion, securities, antitrust and breach of contract claims, among others. Certain of these pending product and other product-related legal proceedings\ncould result in losses that could be substantial. The accrued liability and/or disclosure for the pending product liability and other product-related legal proceedings requires a complex\nseries of judgments by the Company about future events, which involves a number of uncertainties.\nWe identified the evaluation of product liability and other product-related litigation as a critical audit matter. Challenging auditor judgment was required to evaluate the Company\u2019s\njudgments about future events and uncertainties.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls\nover the Company\u2019s product liability and other product-related litigation processes, including controls related to (1) the evaluation of information from external and internal legal counsel,\n(2) forward-looking expectations, and (3) new legal proceedings, or other legal proceedings not currently reserved or disclosed. We read letters received directly from the Company\u2019s\nexternal and internal legal counsel that described the Company\u2019s probable or reasonably possible legal contingency to pending product liability and other product-related legal\nproceedings. We inspected the Company\u2019s minutes from meetings of the Audit Committee, which included the status of key litigation matters. We evaluated the Company\u2019s ability to\nestimate its monetary exposure to pending product and other product-related legal proceedings by comparing historically recorded liabilities to actual monetary amounts incurred upon\nresolution of prior legal matters. We analyzed relevant publicly available information about the Company, its competitors, and the industry.\n \nWe have not been able to determine the specific year that we or our predecessor firms began serving as the Company\u2019s auditor, however, we are aware that we or our predecessor firms\nhave served as the Company\u2019s auditor since at least 1942.\nNew York, New York\nFebruary 23,

"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\nNote 1. Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies\nA. Basis of Presentation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our parent company and all subsidiaries and are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The decision of whether or not to\nconsolidate an entity for financial reporting purposes requires consideration of majority voting interests, as well as effective economic or other control over the entity. Typically, we do not\nseek control by means other than voting interests. For subsidiaries operating outside the U.S., the financial information is included as of and for the year ended November 30 for each year\npresented. Pfizer's fiscal year-end for U.S. subsidiaries is as of and for the year ended December 31 for each year presented. Substantially all unremitted earnings of international\nsubsidiaries are free of legal and contractual restrictions. All significant transactions among our subsidiaries have been eliminated.\nBeginning in the fourth quarter of 2021, we reorganized our commercial operations and began to manage our commercial operations through a global structure consisting of two operating\nsegments, each led by a single manager: Biopharma, our innovative science-based biopharmaceutical business, and PC1, our global contract development and manufacturing organization\nand a leading supplier of specialty active pharmaceutical ingredients. Beginning in the third quarter of 2022, we made several additional organizational changes to further transform our\noperations to better leverage our expertise in certain areas and in anticipation of potential future new product or indication launches. These changes include establishing a new commercial\nstructure within Biopharma, optimizing our end-to-end R&D operations and further prioritizing our internal R&D portfolio, as well as realigning certain enabling and platform functions across\nthe organization to ensure alignment with this new operating structure. Biopharma is the only reportable segment. See Note 17.\nOn December 31, 2021, we completed the sale of our Meridian subsidiary, the manufacturer of EpiPen and other auto-injector products. Prior to its sale, Meridian was managed within the\nformer Hospital product portfolio. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021, the financial results of Meridian were reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented. On December\n21, 2020, Pfizer and Viatris completed the termination of a pre-existing strategic collaboration between Pfizer and Mylan for generic drugs in Japan (the Mylan-Japan collaboration) pursuant\nto an agreement dated November 13, 2020, and we transferred related inventories and operations that were part of the Mylan-Japan collaboration to Viatris. On November 16, 2020, we\ncompleted the spin-off and the combination of our Upjohn Business with Mylan to form Viatris. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, the financial results of the Upjohn Business and the\nMylan-Japan collaboration were reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Upon completion of the spin-off of the Upjohn Business on November 16, 2020, the Upjohn\nassets and liabilities were derecognized from our consolidated balance sheet and are reflected in Retained Earnings\u2013Distribution of Upjohn Business in the consolidated statement of equity.\nPrior to the spin-off of the Upjohn Business in November 2020, the Upjohn Business, the Mylan-Japan collaboration and Meridian were managed as part of our former Upjohn operating\nsegment. With the separation of the Upjohn Business, the Mylan-Japan collaboration and Meridian, as well as the formation of the Consumer Healthcare JV in 2019, Pfizer transformed into\na more focused, global leader in science-based innovative medicines and vaccines.

Certain amounts in the\nconsolidated financial statements and associated notes may not add due to rounding. All percentages have been calculated using unrounded amounts.\nB. New Accounting Standard Adopted in 2022\nOn January 1, 2022, we early adopted a new accounting standard for contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination. Under the new standard, acquired contract\nassets and contract liabilities are required to be recognized and measured by the acquirer on the acquisition date in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 606. This new\nguidance generally results in the acquirer recognizing contract assets and contract liabilities at the same amounts that were recorded by the acquiree. Previously, these amounts were\nrecognized by the acquirer at fair value as of the acquisition date. We adopted this new standard on a prospective basis and there was no impact to our consolidated financial statements.\nC. Estimates and Assumptions\nIn preparing these financial statements, we use certain estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and disclosures. These estimates and assumptions can impact all elements\nof our financial statements. For example, in the consolidated statements of income, estimates are used when accounting for deductions from revenues, determining the cost of inventory\nthat is sold, allocating cost in the form of depreciation and amortization, and estimating restructuring charges and the impact of contingencies, as well as determining provisions for taxes on\nincome. On the consolidated balance sheets, estimates are used in determining the valuation and recoverability of assets, and in determining the reported amounts of liabilities, all of which\nalso impact the consolidated statements of income. Certain estimates of fair value and amounts recorded in connection with acquisitions, revenue deductions, impairment reviews,\nrestructuring-associated charges, investments and financial instruments, valuation allowances, pension and postretirement benefit plans, contingencies, share-based compensation, and\nother calculations can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions.\nOur estimates are often based on complex judgments and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable, but that can be inherently uncertain and unpredictable. If our estimates and\nassumptions are not representative of actual outcomes, our results could be materially impacted. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, our estimates and\nassumptions may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate, or unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that might cause us to change those estimates and assumptions. We are\nsubject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from estimated amounts, such as changes in the healthcare environment, competition, litigation, legislation and\nregulations. We regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions using historical experience and expectations about the future. We adjust our estimates and assumptions when facts and\ncircumstances indicate the need for change.\nPfizer Inc. 2022 Form 10-K 53", "start_char_idx": 4100, "end_char_idx": 7414, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "55652286-e5ce-48f1-960a-7896ed0b4761": {"__data__": {"id_": "55652286-e5ce-48f1-960a-7896ed0b4761", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "61", "file_name": "pfizer_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "data\\pfizer_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf_part_60", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "61", "file_name": "pfizer_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "a31bbb72ceed4c4b4e3d843c1e611636d932f13f038ecdabd46568514cde5820"}, "3": {"node_id": "76d4c310-8ac4-4b46-838c-e38ab5609a8a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "61", "file_name": "pfizer_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "8c44ce12ce2959bec2a009c1bd5195fdc929471d47d9df85778e44388d2ad43a"}}, "hash": "b3003a63e41be7546011258c66c3e0eb2671a09df96fcae4c1c3c845c7beb2d7", "text": "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\nD. Acquisitions\nOur consolidated financial statements include the operations of acquired businesses after the completion of the acquisitions. We account for acquired businesses using the acquisition\nmethod of accounting, which requires, among other things, that most assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date and that\nthe fair value of acquired IPR&D be recorded on the balance sheet. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred. Any excess of the consideration transferred over the assigned values of the\nnet assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. When we acquire net assets that do not constitute a business, as defined in U.S. GAAP, no goodwill is recognized and acquired IPR&D is\nexpensed in Acquired in-process research and development expenses.\nContingent consideration in a business combination is included as part of the acquisition cost and is recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. Fair value is generally estimated by\nusing a probability-weighted discounted cash flow approach. See Note 16D. Any liability resulting from contingent consideration is remeasured to fair value at each reporting date until the\ncontingency is resolved. These changes in fair value are recognized in earnings in Other (income)/deductions\u2013\u2013net.\nE. Fair Value\nWe measure certain assets and liabilities at fair value, either upon initial recognition or for subsequent accounting or reporting. We estimate fair value using an exit price approach, which\nrequires, among other things, that we determine the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly market. The determination of an exit price is\nconsidered from the perspective of market participants, considering the highest and best use of non-financial assets and, for liabilities, assuming that the risk of non-performance will be the\nsame before and after the transfer.\nWhen estimating fair value, depending on the nature and complexity of the asset or liability, we may use one or all of the following techniques:\n\u2022Income approach, which is based on the present value of a future stream of net cash flows.\n\u2022Market approach, which is based on market prices and other information from market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities.\n\u2022Cost approach, which is based on the cost to acquire or construct comparable assets, less an allowance for functional and/or economic obsolescence.\nOur fair value methodologies depend on the following types of inputs:\n\u2022Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets (Level 1 inputs).\n\u2022Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or inputs other than quoted prices\nthat are directly or indirectly observable, or inputs that are derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data by correlation or other means (Level 2 inputs).\n\u2022Unobservable inputs that reflect estimates and assumptions (Level 3 inputs).\nThe following inputs and valuation techniques are used to estimate the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities:\n\u2022Available-for-sale debt securities\u2014third-party matrix-pricing model that uses significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data and credit-adjusted yield curves.\n\u2022Equity securities with readily determinable fair values\u2014quoted market prices and observable NAV prices.\n\u2022Derivative assets and liabilities\u2014third-party matrix-pricing model that uses inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data. Where applicable, these models use market-\nbased observable inputs, including interest rate yield curves to discount future cash flow amounts, and forward and spot prices for currencies.

Foreign Currency Translation\nFor most of our international operations, local currencies have been determined to be the functional currencies. We translate functional currency assets and liabilities to their U.S. dollar\nequivalents at exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date and income and expense amounts at average exchange rates for the period. The U.S. dollar effects that arise from\nchanging translation rates are recorded in Other comprehensive income/(loss). The effects of converting non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities into the functional currency\nare recorded in Other (income)/deductions\u2013\u2013net. For operations in highly inflationary economies, we translate monetary items at rates in effect as of the balance sheet date, with translation\nadjustments recorded in Other (income)/deductions\u2013\u2013net, and we translate non-monetary items at historical rates.\nG. Revenues and Trade Accounts Receivable\nRevenue Recognition\u2013\u2013We record revenues from product sales when there is a transfer of control of the product from us to the customer. We typically determine transfer of control based\non when the product is shipped or delivered and title passes to the customer. For certain contracts, the finished product may temporarily be stored at our or our third-party subcontractors\u2019\nlocations under a bill-and-hold arrangement. Revenue is recognized on bill-and-hold arrangements at the point in time when the customer obtains control of the product and all of the\nfollowing criteria have been met: the arrangement is substantive; the product is identified separately as belonging to the customer; the product is ready for physical transfer to the customer;\nand we do not have the ability to use the product or direct it to another customer. In determining when the customer obtains control of the product, we consider certain indicators, including\nwhether we have a present right to payment from\nPfizer Inc. 2022 Form 10-K 54", "start_char_idx": 4095, "end_char_idx": 6365, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "837974b0-dc5c-4311-9279-c99e23920cdc": {"__data__": {"id_": "837974b0-dc5c-4311-9279-c99e23920cdc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "62", "file_name": "pfizer_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "data\\pfizer_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf_part_61", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "62", "file_name": "pfizer_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "8471b4dc3d696e5bcdabf4764e6fff5da231b7e670d897d6b0527204d21e45a9"}, "3": {"node_id": "29eb9ecb-f71f-4c5c-84e8-4c2f86683e10", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "62", "file_name": "pfizer_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "36e5e133756abc44673cb02dfb50dbb354aa83182722f1ee3c87eeeb849cd33d"}}, "hash": "8ec8267788f7f33003b8ed4c9362d293bff9dc8d2c7a79c34fdc9023e950d499", "text": "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\nthe customer, whether title and/or significant risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer and whether customer acceptance has been received.\nOur Sales Contracts\u2013\u2013Sales on credit are typically under short-term contracts. Collections are based on market payment cycles common in various markets, with shorter cycles in the U.S.\nSales are adjusted for sales allowances, chargebacks, rebates and sales returns and cash discounts. Sales returns occur due to LOE, product recalls or a changing competitive\nenvironment.\nDeductions from Revenues\u2013\u2013Our gross product revenues are subject to a variety of deductions, which generally are estimated and recorded in the same period that the revenues are\nrecognized. Such variable consideration represents chargebacks, rebates, sales allowances and sales returns. These deductions represent estimates of the related obligations and, as\nsuch, knowledge and judgment is required when estimating the impact of these revenue deductions on gross sales for a reporting period.\nProvisions for pharmaceutical sales returns\u2013\u2013Provisions are based on a calculation for each market that incorporates the following, as appropriate: local returns policies and practices;\nhistorical returns as a percentage of sales; an understanding of the reasons for past returns; estimated shelf life by product; an estimate of the amount of time between shipment and return\nor lag time; and any other factors that could impact the estimate of future returns, such as LOE, product recalls or a changing competitive environment. Generally, returned products are\ndestroyed, and customers are refunded the sales price in the form of a credit.\nWe record sales incentives as a reduction of revenues at the time the related revenues are recorded or when the incentive is offered, whichever is later. We estimate the cost of our sales\nincentives based on our historical experience with similar incentives programs to predict customer behavior.\nThe following outlines our common sales arrangements:\n\u2022Customers\u2013\u2013Our prescription biopharmaceutical products, with the exception of Paxlovid, are sold principally to wholesalers, but we also sell directly to retailers, hospitals, clinics,\ngovernment agencies and pharmacies. In 2022, we principally sold Paxlovid to government agencies. In the U.S., we primarily sell our vaccines directly to the federal government, CDC,\nwholesalers, individual provider offices, retail pharmacies and integrated delivery systems. Outside the U.S., we primarily sell our vaccines to government and non-government\ninstitutions. Prescription pharmaceutical products that ultimately are used by patients are generally covered under governmental programs, managed care programs and insurance\nprograms, including those managed through PBMs, and are subject to sales allowances and/or rebates payable directly to those programs. Those sales allowances and rebates are\ngenerally negotiated, but government programs may have legislated amounts by type of product (e.g., patented or unpatented).\nSpecifically:\n\u2022In the U.S., we sell our products principally to distributors and hospitals. We also have contracts with managed care programs or PBMs and legislatively mandated contracts with the\nfederal and state governments under which we provide rebates based on medicines utilized by the lives they cover. We record provisions for Medicare, Medicaid, and performance-based\ncontract pharmaceutical rebates based upon our experience ratio of rebates paid and actual prescriptions written during prior periods. We apply the experience ratio to the respective\nperiod\u2019s sales to determine the rebate accrual and related expense. This experience ratio is evaluated regularly to ensure that the historical trends are as current as practicable.

In certain European countries, rebates are calculated on the government\u2019s total unbudgeted pharmaceutical spending or on\nspecific product sales thresholds and we apply an estimated allocation factor against our actual invoiced sales to project the expected level of reimbursement. We obtain third-party\ninformation that helps us to monitor the adequacy of these accruals.\n\u2022Provisions for pharmaceutical chargebacks (primarily reimbursements to U.S. wholesalers for honoring contracted prices and legislated discounts to third parties) closely approximate\nactual amounts incurred, as we settle these deductions generally within two to five weeks of incurring the liability.\nWe recorded direct product sales and/or Alliance revenues of more than $1 billion for each of ten products in 2022, for each of nine products in 2021 and for each of seven products in 2020.\nIn the aggregate, these direct product sales and/or alliance product revenues represented 82% of our revenues in 2022, 75% of our revenues in 2021 and 54% of our revenues in 2020. See\nNote 17C for additional information. The loss or expiration of intellectual property rights can have a significant adverse effect on our revenues as our contracts with customers will generally\nbe at lower selling prices and lower volumes due to added generic competition.

The allowance for credit losses reflects our best estimate of expected credit losses of the\nreceivables portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience, current information, and forecasts of future economic conditions. In developing the estimate for expected credit losses,\ntrade accounts receivables are segmented into pools of assets depending on market (U.S. versus international), delinquency status, and customer type (high risk versus low risk and\ngovernment versus non-government), and fixed reserve percentages are established for each pool of trade accounts receivables.\nIn determining the reserve percentages for each pool of trade accounts receivables, we considered our historical experience with certain customers and customer types, regulatory and\nlegal environments, country and political risk, and other relevant current and future forecasted macroeconomic factors. These credit risk indicators are monitored on a quarterly basis to\ndetermine whether there have been any changes in the economic environment that would indicate the established reserve percentages should be adjusted, and are considered on a\nregional basis to reflect more geographic-specific metrics. Additionally, write-offs and recoveries of customer receivables are tracked against collections on a quarterly basis to determine\nwhether the reserve percentages remain appropriate. When management becomes aware of certain customer-specific factors that impact credit risk, specific allowances for these known\ntroubled accounts are recorded. Trade accounts receivable are written off after all reasonable means to collect the full amount (including litigation, where appropriate) have been exhausted.\nDuring 2022 and 2021, additions to the allowance for credit losses, write-offs and recoveries of customer receivables were not material to our consolidated financial statements.\nH. Collaborative Arrangements\nPayments to and from our collaboration partners are presented in our consolidated statements of income based on the nature of the arrangement (including its contractual terms), the nature\nof the payments and applicable accounting guidance. Under co-promotion agreements, we record the amounts received for our share of gross profits from our collaboration partners as\nAlliance revenues, a component of Revenues, when our collaboration partners are the principal in the transaction and we receive a share of their net sales or profits. Alliance revenues are\nrecorded as we perform co-promotion activities for the collaboration and the collaboration partners sell the products to their customers. The related expenses for selling and marketing these\nproducts including reimbursements to or from our collaboration partners for these costs are included in Selling, informational and administrative expenses. In collaborative arrangements\nwhere we manufacture a product for our collaboration partners, we record revenues when we transfer control of the product to our collaboration partners. In collaboration arrangements\nwhere we are the principal in the transaction, we record amounts paid to collaboration partners for their share of net sales or profits earned, and all royalty payments to collaboration\npartners as Cost of sales. Royalty payments received from collaboration partners are included in Other (income)/deductions\u2014net.\nReimbursements to or from our collaboration partners for development costs are typically recorded in Research and development expenses.

The cost of finished goods, work in process and raw materials is determined using average actual cost. We regularly\nreview our inventories for impairment and reserves are established when necessary. Inventories that are not expected to be sold within 12 months are classified as Other noncurrent assets.\nSee Note 8A.\nJ. Selling, Informational and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, informational and administrative costs are expensed as incurred. Among other things, these expenses include the internal and external costs of marketing, advertising, shipping and\nhandling, IT and legal defense. Advertising expenses totaled approximately $2.8 billion in 2022, $2.0 billion in 2021 and $1.8 billion in 2020. Production costs are expensed as incurred and\nthe costs of TV, radio, and other electronic media and publications are expensed when the related advertising occurs.\nK. Research and Development Expenses\nR&D costs are expensed as incurred. These expenses include the costs of our proprietary R&D efforts, as well as R&D activities performed in connection with certain licensing\narrangements.\nL. Acquired In-Process Research and Development Expenses\nBefore a compound receives regulatory approval, we record upfront and milestone payments we make to third parties under licensing and collaboration arrangements as expense. Upfront\npayments are recorded when incurred, and milestone payments are recorded when the specific milestone has been achieved. Once a compound receives regulatory approval, we record\nany milestone payments in Identifiable intangible assets, less accumulated amortization and, unless the asset is determined to have an indefinite life, we typically amortize the payments on\na straight-line basis over the remaining agreement term or the expected product life cycle, whichever is shorter. In the first quarter of 2022, we began reporting acquired IPR&D expense as\na separate line item in our consolidated statements of income.

Amortization of Intangible Assets, Depreciation and Certain Long-Lived Assets\nLong-lived assets include:\n\u2022Property, plant and equipment, less accumulated depreciation\u2014These assets are recorded at cost, including any significant improvements after purchase, less accumulated depreciation.\nProperty, plant and equipment assets, other than land and construction in progress, are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the individual assets.\nDepreciation begins when the asset is ready for its intended use. For tax purposes, accelerated depreciation methods are used as allowed by tax laws.\n\u2022Identifiable intangible assets, less accumulated amortization\u2014These assets are recorded at fair value at acquisition. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straight-line\nbasis over their estimated useful lives. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized until a useful life can be determined.\n\u2022Goodwill\u2014Goodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred for an acquired business over the assigned values of its net assets. Goodwill is not amortized.\nAmortization of finite-lived acquired intangible assets is included in Amortization of intangible assets.\nWe review our long-lived assets for impairment indicators throughout the year. We perform impairment testing for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill at least annually and for all\nother long-lived assets whenever impairment indicators are present. When necessary, we record impairments of long-lived assets for the amount by which the fair value is less than the\ncarrying value of these assets.\nSpecifically:\n\u2022For finite-lived intangible assets, such as developed technology rights, and for other long-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment, whenever impairment indicators are\npresent, we calculate the undiscounted value of the projected cash flows for the asset, or asset group, and compare this estimated amount to the carrying amount. If the carrying amount\nis greater, we record an impairment loss for the excess of book value over fair value. In addition, in all cases of an impairment review, we reevaluate the remaining useful lives of the\nassets and modify them, as appropriate.\n\u2022For indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as brands and IPR&D assets, when necessary, we determine the fair value of the asset and record an impairment loss, if any, for the excess of\nbook value over fair value. In addition, in all cases of an impairment review other than for IPR&D assets, we re-evaluate whether continuing to characterize the asset as indefinite-lived is\nappropriate.\n\u2022For goodwill, when necessary, we determine the fair value of each reporting unit and record an impairment loss, if any, for the excess of the book value of the reporting unit over the\nimplied fair value.\nN. Restructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity Initiatives\nWe may incur restructuring charges in connection with acquisitions when we implement plans to restructure and integrate the acquired operations or in connection with our cost-reduction\nand productivity initiatives.\n\u2022In connection with acquisition activity, we typically incur costs associated with executing the transactions, integrating the acquired operations (which may include expenditures for\nconsulting and the integration of systems and processes), and restructuring the combined company (which may include charges related to employees, assets and activities that will not\ncontinue in the combined company); and\n\u2022In connection with our cost-reduction/productivity initiatives, we typically incur costs and charges for site closings and other facility rationalization actions, workforce reductions and the\nexpansion of shared services, including the development of global systems.\nIncluded in Restructuring charges and", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4153, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e8a13271-63fe-43fd-a342-cf016b0b25ab": {"__data__": {"id_": "e8a13271-63fe-43fd-a342-cf016b0b25ab", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "64", "file_name": "pfizer_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "data\\pfizer_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf_part_63", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "64", "file_name": "pfizer_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "a2778abe70cef30f857dbd5e21697e621c90d97733afbcca8fa9f2e8b31f0055"}, "2": {"node_id": "14ca9e9a-c817-46b0-9808-793b5ee36db4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "64", "file_name": "pfizer_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "df0baa535a51ce6657f72bbcefcf9b917a1b933bd4e169d1c9f9b21871952fe0"}}, "hash": "bc9988af21bf908b3efda8fdb0ffdb6012ae4cc0a9b1454ad851104b896d0651", "text": "shared services, including the development of global systems.\nIncluded in Restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs are all restructuring charges, as well as certain other costs associated with acquiring and integrating an acquired\nbusiness.

Employee termination costs are generally recorded when the actions are probable and estimable and include\naccrued severance benefits, pension and postretirement benefits, many of which may be paid out during periods after termination. Transaction costs, such as banking, legal, accounting and\nother similar costs incurred in connection with a business acquisition are expensed as incurred.\nOur business and platform functions may be impacted by these actions, including sales and marketing, manufacturing and R&D, as well as our corporate enabling functions (such as digital,\nglobal real estate operations, legal, finance, human resources, worldwide public affairs, compliance and worldwide procurement).\nO. Cash Equivalents and Statement of Cash Flows\nCash equivalents include items almost as liquid as cash, such as certificates of deposit and time deposits with maturity periods of three months or less when purchased. If items meeting\nthis definition are part of a larger investment pool, we classify them as Short-term investments.\nCash flows for financial instruments designated as fair value or cash flow hedges may be included in operating, investing or financing activities, depending on the classification of the items\nbeing hedged. Cash flows for financial instruments designated as net investment hedges are classified according to the nature of the hedging instrument.

Investments and Derivative Financial Instruments\nThe classification of an investment depends on the nature of the investment, our intent and ability to hold the investment, and the degree to which we may exercise influence. Our\ninvestments are primarily comprised of the following:\n\u2022Public equity securities with readily determinable fair values, which are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value reported in Other (income)/deductions\u2014net.\n\u2022Available-for-sale debt securities, which are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value reported in Other comprehensive income/(loss) until realized.\n\u2022Held-to-maturity debt securities, which are carried at amortized cost.\n\u2022Private equity securities without readily determinable fair values and where we have no significant influence are measured at cost minus any impairment and plus or minus adjustments\nresulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer.\n\u2022For equity investments in common stock or in-substance common stock where we have significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, we use the equity-\nmethod of accounting. Under the equity-method, we record our share of the investee\u2019s income and expenses in Other (income)/deductions\u2014net. The excess of the cost of the investment\nover our share of the underlying equity in the net assets of the investee as of the acquisition date is allocated to the identifiable assets and liabilities of the investee, with any remaining\nexcess amount allocated to goodwill. Such investments are initially recorded at cost, which is the fair value of consideration paid and typically does not include contingent consideration.\nRealized gains or losses on sales of investments are determined by using the specific identification cost method.\nWe regularly evaluate all of our financial assets for impairment. For investments in debt and equity, if and when a decline in fair value is determined, an impairment charge is recorded and a\nnew cost basis in the investment is established. For equity-method investments, an impairment charge is recorded only if and when a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-\ntemporary.\nDerivative financial instruments are carried at fair value in certain balance sheet categories (see Note 7A), with changes in fair value reported in net income or, for certain qualifying hedging\nrelationships, in Other comprehensive income/(loss) (see Note 7E).\nQ. Tax Assets and Liabilities and Income Tax Contingencies\nTax Assets and Liabilities\u2013\u2013Current tax assets primarily include (i) tax effects for intercompany transfers of inventory within our combined group, which are recognized in the consolidated\nstatements of income when the inventory is sold to a third party and (ii) income tax receivables that are expected to be recovered either via refunds from taxing authorities or reductions to\nfuture tax obligations.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using\nenacted tax rates and laws. We provide a valuation allowance when we believe that our deferred tax assets are not recoverable based on an assessment of estimated future taxable income\nthat incorporates ongoing, prudent and feasible tax-planning strategies, that would be implemented, if necessary, to realize the deferred tax assets. Amounts recorded for valuation\nallowances requires judgments about future income which can depend heavily on estimates and assumptions. All deferred tax assets and liabilities within the same tax jurisdiction are\npresented as a net amount in the noncurrent section of our consolidated balance sheet.\nThe TCJA subjects a U.S. shareholder to current tax on global intangible low-taxed income earned by certain foreign subsidiaries.

For additional information, see Note 5D for uncertain tax positions and Note 5A for the repatriation tax liability and other estimates and assumptions in\nconnection with the TCJA.\nIncome Tax Contingencies\u2013\u2013We account for income tax contingencies using a benefit recognition model. If we consider that a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit,\nbased solely on the technical merits of the position, we recognize all or a portion of the benefit. We measure the benefit by determining the amount that is greater than 50% likely of being\nrealized upon settlement, presuming that the tax position is examined by the taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information.\nWe regularly monitor our position and subsequently recognize the unrecognized tax benefit: (i) if there are changes in tax law, analogous case law or there is new information that\nsufficiently raise the likelihood of prevailing on the technical merits of the position to \u201cmore likely than not\u201d; (ii) if the statute of limitations expires; or (iii) if there is a completion of an audit\nresulting in a favorable settlement of that tax year with the appropriate agency. Liabilities for uncertain tax positions are classified as current only when we expect to pay cash within the next\n12 months.

Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans\nThe majority of our employees worldwide are covered by defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution plans or both. In the U.S., we have both IRC-qualified and supplemental (non-\nqualified) defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans, as well as other postretirement benefit plans consisting primarily of medical insurance for retirees and their eligible\ndependents. Net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs other than the service costs are recognized in Other (income)/deductions\u2014net.

Each time a pension or postretirement plan is remeasured, the actuarial gain or loss\nis recognized immediately and classified as Other (income)/deductions\u2013\u2013net. We recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of each of our defined benefit plans as an asset or liability.\nThe obligations are generally measured at the actuarial present value of all benefits attributable to employee service rendered, as provided by the applicable benefit formula. Our pension\nand other postretirement obligations may be determined using assumptions such as discount rate, expected annual rate of return on plan assets, expected employee turnover and\nparticipant mortality. For our pension plans, the obligation may also include assumptions as to future compensation levels. For our other postretirement benefit plans, the obligation may\ninclude assumptions as to the expected cost of providing medical insurance benefits, as well as the extent to which those costs are shared with the employee or others (such as\ngovernmental programs). Plan assets are measured at fair value.\nS. Legal and Environmental Contingencies\nWe and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to numerous contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business, such as patent litigation, product liability and other product-related\nlitigation, commercial and other asserted or unasserted matters, environmental claims and proceedings, government investigations and guarantees and indemnifications. In assessing\ncontingencies related to legal and environmental proceedings that are pending against the Company, or unasserted claims that are probable of being asserted, we record accruals for these\ncontingencies to the extent that we conclude that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. If some amount within a range of loss appears to be a better estimate than any other\namount within the range, we accrue that amount. Alternatively, when no amount within a range of loss appears to be a better estimate than any other amount, we accrue the lowest amount\nin the range. We record anticipated recoveries under existing insurance contracts when recovery is assured.\nT. Share-Based Payments\nOur compensation programs can include share-based payments. Generally, grants under share-based payment programs are accounted for at fair value and these fair values are generally\namortized on a straight-line basis or on an accelerated attribution approach over the vesting terms with the related costs recorded in Cost of sales, Selling, informational and administrative\nexpenses and/or Research and development expenses, as appropriate.\nNote 2.

The transaction includes the acquisition of Biohaven\u2019s CGRP programs, including rimegepant, zavegepant and a portfolio of five pre-clinical CGRP assets.\nUnder the terms of the agreement, we acquired all outstanding common shares of Biohaven not already owned by us for $148.50 per share, in cash, for payments of approximately $11.5\nbillion, plus repayment of third-party debt of $863 million and redemption of Biohaven\u2019s redeemable preferred stock for $495 million.

The total fair value of the consideration transferred was $11.2 billion ($10.9 billion, net of cash\nacquired).

The Transactions were structured as an all-stock, Reverse Morris Trust transaction. Specifically, (i) we contributed the Upjohn Business to a wholly owned subsidiary, which was\nrenamed Viatris, so that the Upjohn Business was separated from the remainder of our business (the Separation), (ii) following the Separation, we distributed, on a pro rata basis, all of the\nshares of Viatris common stock held by Pfizer to Pfizer stockholders as of the November 13, 2020 record date, such that each Pfizer stockholder as of the record date received\napproximately 0.124079 shares of Viatris common stock per share of Pfizer common stock (the Distribution); and (iii) immediately after the Distribution, the Upjohn Business combined with\nMylan in a series of transactions in which Mylan shareholders received one share of Viatris common stock for each Mylan ordinary share held by such shareholder, subject to any applicable\nwithholding taxes (the Combination). Prior to the Distribution, Viatris made a cash payment to Pfizer equal to $12.0 billion as partial consideration for the contribution of the Upjohn Business\nto Viatris. As of the closing of the Combination, Pfizer stockholders owned approximately 57% of the outstanding shares of Viatris common stock, and Mylan shareholders owned\napproximately 43% of the outstanding shares of Viatris common stock, in each case on a fully diluted, as-converted and as-exercised basis. The Transactions are generally expected to be\ntax free to Pfizer and Pfizer stockholders for U.S. tax purposes.

Proceeds from the debt offerings and other financing arrangements were used to fund the $12.0 billion cash distribution Viatris\nmade to Pfizer prior to the Distribution. We used the cash distribution proceeds to pay down commercial paper borrowings and redeem the $1.15 billion aggregate principal amount\noutstanding of our 1.95% senior unsecured notes that were due in June 2021 and $342 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of our 5.80% senior unsecured notes that were due\nin August 2023, before the maturity date.

Equity-Method Investments\nHaleon/Consumer Healthcare JV\u2013\u2013On July 31, 2019, we completed a transaction in which we and GSK combined our respective consumer healthcare businesses into a new JV that\noperated globally under the GSK Consumer Healthcare name. In exchange for the contribution of our consumer healthcare business to the JV, we received a 32% equity stake in the new\ncompany and GSK owned the remaining 68%. On July 18, 2022, GSK completed a demerger of the Consumer Healthcare JV which became Haleon, an independent, publicly traded\ncompany listed on the London Stock Exchange that holds the joint Consumer Healthcare business of GSK and Pfizer following the demerger. We continue to own 32% of the ordinary\nshares of Haleon after the demerger, and we account for our interest in Haleon/the Consumer Healthcare JV as an equity-method investment.\nThe carrying value of our investment in Haleon as of December 31, 2022 and in the Consumer Healthcare JV as of December 31, 2021 is $10.8 billion and $16.3 billion, respectively, and is\nreported", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3617, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7f4e6a6d-220c-4fab-94bb-8ed193b109d1": {"__data__": {"id_": "7f4e6a6d-220c-4fab-94bb-8ed193b109d1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "69", "file_name": "pfizer_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "data\\pfizer_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf_part_68", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "69", "file_name": "pfizer_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "164a20e78dc0582664db95537ec0aff603395a8530143ab21e5701fbe7555dcf"}, "2": {"node_id": "942a0e06-2db6-435f-a1f6-261b8ceeb821", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "69", "file_name": "pfizer_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "f95cd622af393712092a7951c771ed6ff3c153ac6a28da5ee9c307451bddd354"}}, "hash": "e312a9017730313e464b6147ea534b759dc0a0df8a1acb5980e3391d4f7c44e5", "text": "is $10.8 billion and $16.3 billion, respectively, and is\nreported in Equity-method investments. The fair value of our investment in Haleon as of December 31, 2022, based on quoted market prices of Haleon stock, was $11.7 billion. Haleon/the\nConsumer Healthcare JV is a foreign investee whose reporting currency is the U.K. pound, and therefore we translate its financial statements into U.S. dollars and recognize the impact of\nforeign currency translation adjustments in the carrying value of our investment and in other comprehensive income. The decrease in the value of our investment from December 31, 2021\nto December 31, 2022 is primarily due to dividends totaling approximately $4.5 billion, of which cash flows of $4.0 billion are included in Net cash provided by/(used in) investing activities\nand $584 million are included in Net cash provided by operating activities, as well as $1.4 billion in pre-tax foreign currency translation adjustments (see Note 6), partially offset by our share\nof Haleon/the Consumer Healthcare JV\u2019s earnings. We record our share of earnings from Haleon/the Consumer Healthcare JV on a quarterly basis on a one-quarter lag in Other\n(income)/deductions\u2013\u2013net. Our total share of Haleon/the Consumer Healthcare JV\u2019s earnings generated in the fourth quarter of 2021 and the first nine months of 2022, which we recorded in\nour operating results in 2022, was $536 million. Our total share of the JV\u2019s earnings generated in the fourth quarter of 2020 and the first nine months of 2021, which we recorded in our\noperating results in 2021, was $495 million. Our total share of the JV\u2019s earnings generated in the fourth quarter of 2019 and the first nine months of 2020, which we recorded in our\noperating results in 2020, was $417 million. As part of the initial accounting for our investment in the Consumer Healthcare JV in 2019, we determined that the difference between the initial\nfair value of our investment less our underlying equity in the carrying value of the net assets of the JV resulted in an initial excess basis difference of $4.8 billion. We allocated the difference\nprimarily to inventory, definite-lived intangible assets, indefinite-lived intangible assets, related deferred tax liabilities, and equity-method goodwill. We recognize amortization of these basis\ndifferences in Other (income)/deductions\u2013\u2013net. Amortization of basis differences on inventory and related deferred tax liabilities was completely recognized by the second quarter of 2020.\nBasis differences on definite-lived intangible assets and related deferred tax liabilities are being amortized over the lives of the underlying assets, which range from 8 to 20 years. In 2022,\nour equity-method income included in Other (income)/ deductions\u2013\u2013net also includes charges of $100 million, primarily for adjustments to our equity-method basis differences related to the\nseparation of Haleon/the Consumer Healthcare JV from GSK.

Neither we nor any of our subsidiaries were an issuer or\nguarantor of any of the notes.\nFollowing its issuance of the notes in March 2022, which fell in our international second quarter of 2022, the Consumer Healthcare JV loaned to us and GSK the net proceeds received from\nthe notes on a pro rata equity ownership basis, for which we received a loan of \u00a32.9 billion ($3.7 billion as of the end of our second quarter of 2022), at an interest rate of 1.365% per annum\npayable semi-annually in arrears.

Licensing Arrangements\nAgreement with Valneva\u2013\u2013On April 30, 2020, we signed an agreement to co-develop and commercialize Valneva\u2019s Lyme disease vaccine candidate, VLA15, which covers six serotypes that\nare prevalent in North America and Europe. Valneva and Pfizer will work closely together throughout the development of VLA15. Valneva is eligible to receive a total of up to $308 million in\ncash payments from us consisting of a $130 million upfront payment, which was paid and recorded in Acquired in-process research and development expenses in our second quarter of\n2020, as well as $35 million in development milestones which were paid and recorded in Acquired in-process research and development expenses in 2021 and 2022, and $143 million in\nearly commercialization milestones which remain unpaid. Under the terms of the agreement, Valneva was to fund 30% of all development costs through completion of the development\nprogram, and in return we were to pay Valneva tiered royalties. We will lead late-stage development and have sole control over commercialization.\nIn June 2022, we entered into an Equity Subscription Agreement, under which we invested \u20ac90.5 million ($95 million) in Valneva to further support our strategic Lyme arrangement. In\naddition, we updated the terms of our existing agreement for VLA15. Valneva will now fund 40% of the remaining shared development costs, and we will pay Valneva tiered royalties ranging\nfrom 14% to 22%, compared to royalties starting at 19% in the initial agreement. In addition, the royalties will be complemented by up to $100 million in milestones payable to Valneva based\non cumulative sales. Other early commercialization milestones are unchanged. As of December 31, 2022, we held a 6.9% equity stake of Valneva.\nE. Collaborative Arrangements\nWe enter into collaborative arrangements with respect to in-line medicines, as well as medicines in development that require completion of research and regulatory approval. Collaborative\narrangements are contractual agreements with third parties that involve a joint operating activity, typically a research and/or commercialization effort, where both we and our partner are\nactive participants in the activity and are exposed to the significant risks and rewards of the activity. Our rights and obligations under our collaborative arrangements vary. For example, we\nhave agreements to co-promote pharmaceutical products discovered by us or other companies, and we have agreements where we partner to co-develop and/or participate together in\ncommercializing, marketing, promoting, manufacturing and/or distributing a drug product.\nCollaboration with Biohaven\u2013\u2013In November 2021, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement and related sublicense agreement with Biohaven and certain of its subsidiaries to\ncommercialize rimegepant and zavegepant for the treatment and prevention of migraines outside of the U.S., subject to regulatory approval.

Under the terms of the agreement, we agreed to pay BioNTech\n$225 million, including an upfront cash payment of $75 million and an equity investment of $150 million. BioNTech is eligible to receive future regulatory and sales milestone payments of up\nto $200 million. In return, BioNTech agreed to pay us $25 million for our proprietary antigen technology. The net upfront payment to BioNTech was recorded to Acquired in-process research\nand development expenses in our fourth quarter of 2021. We and BioNTech share development costs. We will have commercialization rights to the potential vaccine worldwide, excluding\nGermany, Turkey and certain developing countries where BioNTech will have commercialization rights. We and BioNTech will share gross profits from commercialization of any product.\nOn April 9, 2020, we signed a global agreement with BioNTech to co-develop a mRNA-based coronavirus vaccine program aimed at preventing COVID-19 infection, which resulted in the\ndevelopment of Comirnaty. In connection with the April 2020 agreement, we made an upfront cash payment of $72 million and an equity investment in the common stock of BioNTech of\n$113 million. We recognized $98 million for the upfront payment and a premium paid on the equity investment in Acquired in-process research and development expenses in our second\nquarter of 2020. BioNTech became eligible to receive potential milestone payments of up to $563 million for a total consideration of $748 million. Under the terms of this agreement, we and\nBioNTech share gross profits and development costs equally after approval and successful commercialization of the vaccine, and we were responsible for all of the development costs until\ncommercialization of the vaccine. Thereafter, BioNTech was to repay us its 50 percent share of these development costs through reductions in gross profit sharing and milestone payments\nto BioNTech over time. On January 29, 2021, we and BioNTech signed an amended version of the April 2020 agreement. Under the January 2021 agreement, BioNTech paid us their 50\npercent share of prior development costs in a lump sum payment during the first quarter of 2021. Further R&D costs are being shared equally. We have commercialization rights to the\nvaccine worldwide, excluding Germany and Turkey where BioNTech markets and distributes the vaccine under the agreement with us, and excluding China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan,\nwhich are subject to a separate collaboration between BioNTech and Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical (Group) Co., Ltd.

Restructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity Initiatives\nA. Transforming to a More Focused Company Program\nWith the formation of the Consumer Healthcare JV in 2019 and the spin-off of our former Upjohn Business in the fourth quarter of 2020, Pfizer transformed into a more focused, global\nleader in science-based innovative medicines and vaccines. We took efforts to ensure our cost base and support model aligned appropriately with our operating structure. While certain\ndirect costs transferred to the Consumer Healthcare JV in 2019, and to the Upjohn Business in connection with the spin-off, there are indirect costs which did not transfer. This program is\nprimarily composed of the following initiatives:\n\u2022We took steps to restructure our corporate enabling functions to appropriately support our business, R&D and PGS platform functions. Actions included, among others, changes in\nlocation of certain activities, expanded use and co-location of centers of excellence and shared services, and increased use of digital technologies. The associated actions and the\nspecific costs primarily included severance and benefit plan impacts, exit costs as well as associated implementation costs.\n\u2022In addition, we transformed our commercial go-to market model in the way we engage patients and physicians. We also made several organizational changes in the third quarter of 2022\nto further transform our operations to better leverage our expertise in certain areas and in anticipation of potential future new product or indication launches (see Note 1A). Actions\nincluded, among others, centralization of certain activities and enhanced use of digital technologies. The costs for this effort primarily included severance and associated implementation\ncosts.\n\u2022We also optimized our manufacturing network under this program and incurred one-time costs for cost-reduction initiatives related to our manufacturing operations. The costs for this\neffort included, among other things, severance costs, implementation costs, product transfer costs, site exit costs, as well as accelerated depreciation.\n\u2022In the fourth quarter of 2022, we began taking steps to optimize our end-to-end R&D operations to reduce costs and cycle times as well as to further prioritize our internal R&D portfolio in\nareas where our capabilities are differentiated while increasing external innovation efforts to leverage an expanding and productive biotech sector. Actions include leveraging automation\nand digital capabilities, novel clinical development approaches and capabilities, and externalization of select assets and R&D units. We expect costs for this effort of $500 million to be\nincurred primarily through 2023, with costs to primarily represent cash expenditures. The costs for this effort primarily include severance costs and associated implementation costs.\nFrom the start of this program in the fourth quarter of 2019 through December 31, 2022, we incurred costs of $3.5 billion, of which $1.4 billion ($1.0 billion of restructuring charges) is\nassociated with Biopharma. We have incurred approximately 85% of total expected costs to date, and we expect the remaining costs to be substantially incurred through 2023.\nB.

Tax Contingencies\nFor a description of our accounting policies associated with accounting for income tax contingencies, see Note 1Q.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nAs tax law is complex and often subject to varied interpretations, it is uncertain whether some of our tax positions will be sustained upon audit.

These potential benefits generally result from cooperative efforts among taxing authorities, as required by tax treaties to minimize double taxation, commonly referred to as\nthe competent authority process. The recoverability of these assets, which we believe to be more likely than not, is dependent upon the actual payment of taxes in one tax jurisdiction\nand, in some cases, the successful petition for recovery in another tax jurisdiction. As of December 31, 2022, we had $1.5 billion in assets associated with uncertain tax positions. These\namounts were included in Noncurrent deferred tax assets and other noncurrent tax assets ($1.5 billion) and Other taxes payable ($45 million).

Derivative financial\ninstruments are executed under International Swaps and Derivatives Association master agreements with credit-support annexes that contain zero threshold provisions requiring collateral\nto be exchanged daily depending on levels of exposure. As a result, there are no significant concentrations of credit risk with any individual financial institution.

We possess\na well-diversified portfolio of hundreds of developed technology rights across therapeutic categories, representing our commercialized products.

Also\nincluded in this category are the post-approval milestone payments made under our alliance agreements for certain prescription pharmaceutical products.\nBrands\u2013\u2013Brands represent the cost for tradenames and know-how, as the products themselves do not receive patent protection. Indefinite-lived brands include Medrol and Depo-Medrol,\nwhile finite-lived brands include Zavedos and Depo-Provera.\nIPR&D\u2013\u2013IPR&D assets represent R&D assets acquired through business combinations that have not yet received regulatory approval in a major market. The significant components of\nIPR&D are etrasimod, GBT601, talazoparib, Braftovi/Mektovi and zavegepant. IPR&D assets are required to be classified as indefinite-lived assets until the successful completion or the\nabandonment of the associated R&D effort.

The allocation of goodwill is a complex process that requires, among other things, that we determine the fair value of each reporting unit under our old and new organizational\nstructure and the portions being transferred. We completed this re-allocation during the fourth quarter 2022 and concluded that none of our goodwill was impaired.

Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans and Defined Contribution Plans\nThe majority of our employees worldwide are eligible for retirement benefits provided through defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution plans or both. In the U.S., we sponsor both\nIRC-qualified and supplemental (non-qualified) defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans. A qualified plan meets the requirements of certain sections of the IRC, and, generally,\ncontributions to qualified plans are tax deductible. A qualified plan typically provides benefits to a broad group of employees with restrictions on discriminating in favor of highly compensated\nemployees with regard to coverage, benefits and contributions. A supplemental (non-qualified) plan provides additional benefits to certain employees. In addition, we provide medical\ninsurance benefits to certain retirees and their eligible dependents through our postretirement plans.\nA.

Equity\nA. Common Stock Purchases\nWe purchase our common stock through privately negotiated transactions or in the open market as circumstances and prices warrant. Purchased shares under a share-purchase plan,\nwhich is authorized by our BOD, are available for general corporate purposes. In December 2018, the BOD authorized a $10 billion share repurchase program to be utilized over time and\nshare repurchases commenced thereunder in the first quarter of 2019.\nIn the first quarter of 2022, we purchased 39 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $2 billion under our publicly announced share purchase plan. Our remaining share-purchase\nauthorization was approximately $3.3 billion at December 31, 2022.\nB. Preferred Stock and Employee Stock Ownership Plans\nPrior to May 4, 2020, we had outstanding Series A convertible perpetual preferred stock (the Series A Preferred Stock) that was held by an ESOP trust (the Trust). All outstanding shares of\nSeries A Preferred Stock were converted, at the direction of the independent fiduciary under the Trust and in accordance with the certificate of designations for the Series A Preferred Stock,\ninto shares of our common stock on May 4, 2020. The Trust received an aggregate of 1,070,369 shares of our common stock upon conversion, with zero shares of Series A Preferred Stock\nremaining outstanding as a result of the conversion. In December 2020, we filed a certificate of elimination to our restated certificate of incorporation, as amended and a restated certificate\nof incorporation with the Delaware Secretary of State, which eliminated the Series A Preferred Stock.\nWe have one ESOP that holds common stock of the Company (Common ESOP). As of December 31, 2022, all shares of common stock held by the Common ESOP have been allocated to\nthe Pfizer U.S. defined contribution plan participants.

Share-Based Payments\nOur compensation programs can include share-based payment awards with value that is determined by reference to the fair value of our shares and that provide for the grant of shares or\noptions to acquire shares or similar arrangements. Our share-based awards are designed based on competitive survey data or industry peer groups used for compensation purposes, and\nare allocated between different long-term incentive awards, generally in the form of Total Shareholder Return Units (TSRUs), Restricted Stock Units (RSUs), Portfolio Performance Shares\n(PPSs), Performance Share Awards (PSAs), Breakthrough Performance Awards (BPAs) and stock options, as determined by the Compensation Committee of our BOD.\nThe 2019 Stock Plan (2019 Plan) replaced and superseded the 2014 Plan. It provides for 400 million shares, in addition to shares remaining under the 2014 Plan, to be authorized for\ngrants. As of December 31, 2022, no shares remain under the 2014 Plan. The 2019 Plan provides that the number of stock options, TSRUs, RSUs, or performance-based awards that may\nbe granted to any one individual during any 36-month period is limited to 20 million shares, and that RSUs count as three shares, PPSs, PSAs and BPAs count as three shares times the\nmaximum potential payout, while TSRUs and stock options count as one share, toward the maximum shares available under the 2019 Plan. As of December 31, 2022, 270 million shares\nwere available for award, including 27 million shares that we assumed from the remaining shares available from the stock plans of GBT, Arena and Biohaven which can be issued to legacy\nemployees of the acquired companies and newly hired employees after the dates of the respective acquisitions.

See Note 12.\nNote 15. Leases\nWe lease real estate, fleet, and equipment for use in our operations. Our leases generally have lease terms of 1 to 30 years, some of which include options to terminate or extend leases for\nup to 5 to 10 years or on a month-to-month basis. We include options that are reasonably certain to be exercised as part of the determination of lease terms. We may negotiate termination\nclauses in anticipation of any changes in market conditions, but generally these termination options have not been exercised. Residual value guarantees are generally not included within\nour operating leases with the exception of some fleet leases. In addition to base rent payments, the leases may require us to pay directly for taxes and other non-lease components, such as\ninsurance, maintenance and other operating expenses, which may be dependent on usage or vary month-to-month. Variable lease payments amounted to $536 million in 2022, $381 million\nin 2021 and $380 million in 2020. We elected the practical expedient to not separate non-lease components from lease components in calculating the amounts of ROU assets and lease\nliabilities for all underlying asset classes.\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception of the contract and we perform the lease classification test as of the lease commencement date. ROU assets represent our right to\nuse an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are\nrecognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term.

Contingencies and Certain Commitments\nWe and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to numerous contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business, including tax and legal contingencies, guarantees and indemnifications.\nThe following outlines our legal contingencies, guarantees and indemnifications. For a discussion of our tax contingencies, see Note 5D.\nA. Legal Proceedings\nOur legal contingencies include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022Patent litigation, which typically involves challenges to the coverage and/or validity of patents on various products, processes or dosage forms. An adverse outcome could result in loss of\npatent protection for a product, a significant loss of revenues from a product or impairment of the value of associated assets. We are the plaintiff in the majority of these actions.\n\u2022Product liability and other product-related litigation related to current or former products, which can include personal injury, consumer, off-label promotion, securities, antitrust and breach\nof contract claims, among others, and often involves highly complex issues relating to medical causation, label warnings and reliance on those warnings, scientific evidence and findings,\nactual, provable injury and other matters.\n\u2022Commercial and other asserted or unasserted matters, which can include acquisition-, licensing-, intellectual property-, collaboration- or co-promotion-related and product-pricing claims\nand environmental claims and proceedings, and can involve complexities that will vary from matter to matter.\n\u2022Government investigations, which often are related to the extensive regulation of pharmaceutical companies by national, state and local government agencies in the U.S. and in other\njurisdictions.\nCertain of these contingencies could result in increased expenses and/or losses, including damages, royalty payments, fines and/or civil penalties, which could be substantial, and/or\ncriminal charges.\nWe believe that our claims and defenses in matters in which we are a defendant are substantial, but litigation is inherently unpredictable and excessive verdicts do occur. We do not believe\nthat any of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial position. However, we could incur judgments, enter into settlements or revise our expectations regarding the\noutcome of matters, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and/or our cash flows in the period in which the amounts are accrued or paid.\nWe have accrued for losses that are both probable and reasonably estimable. Substantially all of our contingencies are subject to significant uncertainties and, therefore, determining the\nlikelihood of a loss and/or the measurement of any loss can be complex.

For proceedings under environmental laws to which a governmental authority is a party, we have adopted a disclosure threshold of $1 million in potential or actual\ngovernmental monetary sanctions.\nThe principal pending matters to which we are a party are discussed below. In determining whether a pending matter is a principal matter, we consider both quantitative and qualitative\nfactors to assess materiality, such as, among others, the amount of damages and the nature of other relief sought, if specified; our view of the merits of the claims and of the strength of our\ndefenses; whether the action purports to be, or is, a class action and, if not certified, our view of the likelihood that a class will be certified by the court; the jurisdiction in which the\nproceeding is pending; whether related actions have been transferred to multidistrict litigation; any experience that we or, to our knowledge, other companies have had in similar\nproceedings; whether disclosure of the action would be important to a reader of our financial statements, including whether disclosure might change a reader\u2019s judgment about our financial\nstatements in light of all of the information that is available to the reader; the potential impact of the proceeding on our reputation; and the extent of public interest in the matter. In addition,\nwith respect to patent matters in which we are the plaintiff, we consider, among other things, the financial significance of the product protected by the patent(s) at issue. Some of the matters\ndiscussed below include those which management believes that the likelihood of possible loss in excess of amounts accrued is remote.\nA1. Legal Proceedings\u2013\u2013Patent Litigation\nWe are involved in suits relating to our patents (or those of our collaboration/licensing partners to which we have licenses or co-promotion rights), including but not limited to, those\ndiscussed below. We face claims by generic drug manufacturers that patents covering our products (or those of our collaboration/licensing partners to which we have licenses or co-\npromotion rights and to which we may or may not be a party), processes or dosage forms are invalid and/or do not cover the product of the generic drug manufacturer. Also, counterclaims,\nas well as various independent actions, have been filed alleging that our assertions of, or attempts to enforce, patent rights with respect to certain products constitute unfair competition\nand/or violations of antitrust laws. In addition to the challenges to the U.S. patents that are discussed below, patent rights to certain of our products or those of our collaboration/licensing\npartners are being challenged in various other jurisdictions. Some of our collaboration or licensing partners face challenges to the validity of their patent rights in non-U.S. jurisdictions. For\nexample, in April 2022, the U.K. High Court issued a judgment finding invalid a BMS patent related to Eliquis due to expire in 2026. In November 2022, BMS received permission to appeal\nthe High Court\u2019s decision. Additional challenges are pending in other jurisdictions. Also, in July 2022, CureVac AG (CureVac) brought a patent infringement action against BioNTech and\ncertain of its subsidiaries in the German Regional Court alleging that Comirnaty infringes certain German utility model patents and certain expired and unexpired European patents.\nAdditional challenges involving Comirnaty patents may be filed against us and/or BioNTech in other jurisdictions in the future.

We are also party to patent damages suits in various jurisdictions pursuant to which generic drug manufacturers, payers, governments or other\nparties are seeking damages from us for allegedly causing delay of generic entry.\nWe also are often involved in other proceedings, such as inter partes review, post-grant review, re-examination or opposition proceedings, before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the\nEuropean Patent Office, or other foreign counterparts relating to our intellectual property or the intellectual property rights of others. Also, if one of our patents (or one of our\ncollaboration/licensing partners patents) is found to be invalid by such proceedings, generic or competitive products could be introduced into the market resulting in the erosion of sales of\nour existing products. For example, several of the patents in our pneumococcal vaccine portfolio have been challenged in inter partes review and post-grant review proceedings in the U.S.\nPatent and Trademark Office, as well as outside the U.S. The invalidation of any of the patents in our pneumococcal portfolio could potentially allow additional competitor vaccines, if\napproved, to enter the marketplace earlier than anticipated. In the event that any of the patents are found valid and infringed, a competitor\u2019s vaccine, if approved, might be prohibited from\nentering the market or a competitor might be required to pay us a royalty.\nWe are also subject to patent litigation pursuant to which one or more third parties seek damages and/or injunctive relief to compensate for alleged infringement of its patents by our\ncommercial or other activities. If one of our marketed products (or a product of our collaboration/licensing partners) is found to infringe valid patent rights of a third party, such third party may\nbe awarded significant damages or royalty payments, or we may be prevented from further sales of that product. Such damages may be enhanced as much as three-fold if we or one of our\nsubsidiaries is found to have willfully infringed valid patent rights of a third party.\nActions In Which We Are The Plaintiff\nXeljanz (tofacitinib)\nBeginning in 2017, we brought patent-infringement actions against several generic manufacturers that filed separate abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs) with the FDA seeking\napproval to market their generic versions of tofacitinib tablets in one or both of 5 mg and 10 mg dosage strengths, and in both immediate and extended release forms. To date, we have\nsettled actions with several manufacturers on terms not material to us. The remaining action continues in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware as described below.\nIn October 2021, we brought a separate patent-infringement action against Sinotherapeutics Inc. (Sinotherapeutics) asserting the infringement and validity of our patent covering extended\nrelease formulations of tofacitinib that was challenged by Sinotherapeutics in its ANDA seeking approval to market a generic version of tofacitinib 11 mg extended release tablets. In\nNovember 2022, we filed an additional patent-infringement action against Sinotherapeutics relating to its challenge of our extended release formulation and method of treatment patents in\nits ANDA seeking approval to market a generic version of tofacitinib 22 mg extended release tablets.\nIn November 2022, we brought a separate patent-infringement action against Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Limited and Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, Inc. (collectively, Sun) asserting\nthe infringement and validity of our compound patent covering the active ingredient that was challenged by Sun in its ANDAs seeking approval to market generic versions of tofacitinib\nextended release (11 mg, 22 mg) tablets.

Legal Proceedings\u2013\u2013Product Litigation\nWe are defendants in numerous cases, including but not limited to those discussed below, related to our pharmaceutical and other products. Plaintiffs in these cases seek damages and\nother relief on various grounds for alleged personal injury and economic loss.\nAsbestos\nBetween 1967 and 1982, Warner-Lambert owned American Optical Corporation (American Optical), which manufactured and sold respiratory protective devices and asbestos safety\nclothing. In connection with the sale of American Optical in 1982, Warner-Lambert agreed to indemnify the purchaser for certain liabilities, including certain asbestos-related and other\nclaims. Warner-Lambert was acquired by Pfizer in 2000 and is a wholly owned subsidiary of Pfizer. Warner-Lambert is actively engaged in the defense of, and will continue to explore\nvarious means of resolving, these claims.\nNumerous lawsuits against American Optical, Pfizer and certain of its previously owned subsidiaries are pending in various federal and state courts seeking damages for alleged personal\ninjury from exposure to products allegedly containing asbestos and other allegedly hazardous materials sold by Pfizer and certain of its previously owned subsidiaries.\nThere also are a small number of lawsuits pending in various federal and state courts seeking damages for alleged exposure to asbestos in facilities owned or formerly owned by Pfizer or\nits subsidiaries.\nEffexor\nBeginning in 2011, actions, including purported class actions, were filed in various federal courts against Wyeth and, in certain of the actions, affiliates of Wyeth and certain other defendants\nrelating to Effexor XR, which is the extended-release formulation of Effexor. The plaintiffs in each of the class actions seek to represent a class consisting of all persons in the U.S. and its\nterritories who directly purchased, indirectly purchased or reimbursed patients for the purchase of Effexor XR or generic Effexor XR from any of the defendants from June 14, 2008 until the\ntime the defendants\u2019 allegedly unlawful conduct ceased. The plaintiffs in all of the actions allege delay in the launch of generic Effexor XR in the U.S. and its territories, in violation of federal\nantitrust laws and, in certain of the actions, the antitrust, consumer protection and various other laws of certain states, as the result of Wyeth fraudulently obtaining and improperly listing\ncertain patents for Effexor XR in the Orange Book, enforcing certain patents for Effexor XR and entering into a litigation settlement agreement with a generic drug manufacturer with respect\nto Effexor XR. Each of the plaintiffs seeks treble damages (for itself in the individual actions or on behalf of the putative class in the purported class actions) for alleged price overcharges for\nEffexor XR or generic Effexor XR in the U.S. and its territories since June 14, 2008. All of these actions have been consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey.\nIn 2014, the District Court dismissed the direct purchaser plaintiffs\u2019 claims based on the litigation settlement agreement, but declined to dismiss the other direct purchaser plaintiff claims. In\n2015, the District Court entered partial final judgments as to all settlement agreement claims, including those asserted by direct purchasers and end-payer plaintiffs, which plaintiffs appealed\nto the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.

(Ranbaxy) and certain Ranbaxy affiliates. The plaintiffs in these various actions seek to represent nationwide, multi-state or statewide classes consisting of persons or\nentities who directly purchased, indirectly purchased or reimbursed patients for the purchase of Lipitor (or, in certain of the actions, generic Lipitor) from any of the defendants from March\n2010 until the cessation of the defendants\u2019 allegedly unlawful conduct (the Class Period). The plaintiffs allege delay in the launch of generic Lipitor, in violation of federal antitrust laws and/or\nstate antitrust, consumer protection and various other laws, resulting from (i) the 2008 agreement pursuant to which Pfizer and Ranbaxy settled certain patent litigation involving Lipitor and\nPfizer granted Ranbaxy a license to sell a generic version of Lipitor in various markets beginning on varying dates, and (ii) in certain of the actions, the procurement and/or enforcement of\ncertain patents for Lipitor. Each of the actions seeks, among other things, treble damages on behalf of the putative class for alleged price overcharges for Lipitor (or, in certain of the actions,\ngeneric Lipitor) during the Class Period. In addition, individual actions have been filed against Pfizer, Ranbaxy and certain of their affiliates, among others, that assert claims and seek relief\nfor the plaintiffs that are substantially similar to the claims asserted and the relief sought in the purported class actions described above. These various actions have been consolidated for\npre-trial proceedings in a MDL in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey.\nIn September 2013 and 2014, the District Court dismissed with prejudice the claims of the direct purchasers. In October and November 2014, the District Court dismissed with prejudice the\nclaims of all other MDL plaintiffs. All plaintiffs appealed the District Court\u2019s orders dismissing their claims with prejudice to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. In addition, the\ndirect purchaser class plaintiffs appealed the order denying their motion to amend the judgment and for leave to amend their complaint to the Court of Appeals. In 2017, the Court of Appeals\nreversed the District Court\u2019s decisions and remanded the claims to the District Court.\nAlso, in 2013, the State of West Virginia filed an action in West Virginia state court against Pfizer and Ranbaxy, among others, that asserts claims and seeks relief on behalf of the State of\nWest Virginia and residents of that state that are substantially similar to the claims asserted and the relief sought in the purported class actions described above.\nEpiPen (Direct Purchaser)\nIn February 2020, a lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas against Pfizer, its current and former affiliates King and Meridian, and various Mylan entities, on\nbehalf of a purported U.S. nationwide class of direct purchaser plaintiffs who purchased EpiPen devices directly from the defendants. Plaintiffs in this action generally allege that Pfizer and\nMylan conspired to delay market entry of generic EpiPen through the settlement of patent litigation regarding EpiPen, and thereby delayed market entry of generic EpiPen in violation of\nfederal antitrust law. Plaintiffs seek treble damages for alleged overcharges for EpiPen since 2011.

Legal Proceedings\u2013\u2013Commercial and Other Matters\nMonsanto-Related Matters\nIn 1997, Monsanto Company (Former Monsanto) contributed certain chemical manufacturing operations and facilities to a newly formed corporation, Solutia Inc. (Solutia), and spun off the\nshares of Solutia. In 2000, Former Monsanto merged with Pharmacia & Upjohn Company to form Pharmacia. Pharmacia then transferred its agricultural operations to a newly created\nsubsidiary, named Monsanto Company (New Monsanto), which it spun off in a two-stage process that was completed in 2002. Pharmacia was acquired by Pfizer in 2003 and is a wholly\nowned subsidiary of Pfizer.\nIn connection with its spin-off that was completed in 2002, New Monsanto assumed, and agreed to indemnify Pharmacia for, any liabilities related to Pharmacia\u2019s former agricultural\nbusiness. New Monsanto has defended and/or is defending Pharmacia in connection with various claims and litigation arising out of, or related to, the agricultural business, and has been\nindemnifying Pharmacia when liability has been imposed or settlement has been reached regarding such claims and litigation.\nIn connection with its spin-off in 1997, Solutia assumed, and agreed to indemnify Pharmacia for, liabilities related to Former Monsanto\u2019s chemical businesses. As the result of its\nreorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, Solutia\u2019s indemnification obligations relating to Former Monsanto\u2019s chemical businesses are primarily limited to sites that\nSolutia has owned or operated. In addition, in connection with its spin-off that was completed in 2002, New Monsanto assumed, and agreed to indemnify Pharmacia for, any liabilities\nprimarily related to Former Monsanto\u2019s chemical businesses, including, but not limited to, any such liabilities that Solutia assumed.

The complaint alleges that the defendants\nprovided funding for terrorist organizations through their sales practices pursuant to pharmaceutical and medical device contracts with the Iraqi Ministry of Health, and seeks monetary relief.\nIn July 2020, the District Court granted defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss and dismissed all of plaintiffs\u2019 claims. In January 2022, the Court of Appeals reversed the District Court\u2019s decision. In\nFebruary 2023, the defendants filed for en banc review of the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision.

Legal Proceedings\u2013\u2013Government Investigations\nWe are subject to extensive regulation by government agencies in the U.S., other developed markets and multiple emerging markets in which we operate. Criminal charges, substantial\nfines and/or civil penalties, limitations on our ability to conduct business in applicable jurisdictions, corporate integrity or deferred prosecution agreements, as well as reputational harm and\nincreased public interest in the matter could result from government investigations in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we do business. These matters often involve government\nrequests for information on a voluntary basis or through subpoenas after which the government may seek additional information through follow-up requests or additional subpoenas. In\naddition, in a qui tam lawsuit in which the government declines to intervene, the relator may still pursue a suit for the recovery of civil damages and penalties on behalf of the government.\nAmong the investigations by government agencies are the matters discussed below.\nGreenstone Investigations\n\u2022U.S. Department of Justice Antitrust Division Investigation\nSince July 2017, the U.S. Department of Justice's Antitrust Division has been investigating our former Greenstone generics business. We believe this is related to an ongoing broader\nantitrust investigation of the generic pharmaceutical industry. We have produced records relating to this investigation.\n\u2022State Attorneys General and Multi-District Generics Antitrust Litigation\nIn April 2018, Greenstone received requests for information from the Antitrust Department of the Connecticut Office of the Attorney General. In May 2019, Attorneys General of more than 40\nstates plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico filed a complaint against a number of pharmaceutical companies, including Greenstone and Pfizer. The matter has been consolidated\nwith a MDL in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. As to Greenstone and Pfizer, the complaint alleges anticompetitive conduct in violation of federal and state antitrust laws and state\nconsumer protection laws. In June 2020, the State Attorneys General filed a new complaint against a large number of companies, including Greenstone and Pfizer, making similar\nallegations, but concerning a new set of drugs. This complaint was transferred to the MDL in July 2020. The MDL also includes civil complaints filed by private plaintiffs and state counties\nagainst Pfizer, Greenstone and a significant number of other defendants asserting allegations that generally overlap with those asserted by the State Attorneys General.\nSubpoena & Civil Investigative Demand relating to Tris Pharma/Quillivant XR\nIn October 2018, we received a subpoena from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York (SDNY) seeking records relating to our relationship with another drug\nmanufacturer and its production and manufacturing of drugs including, but not limited to, Quillivant XR. We responded to that subpoena in full and have had no communication with the\nSDNY in connection with the subpoena since June 2019.\nPfizer Inc. 2022 Form 10-K 95", "start_char_idx": 3814, "end_char_idx": 7203, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bb6ed390-bad6-4f21-a600-2d96852a9ea6": {"__data__": {"id_": "bb6ed390-bad6-4f21-a600-2d96852a9ea6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "103", "file_name": "pfizer_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "data\\pfizer_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf_part_102", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "103", "file_name": "pfizer_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "66584914c939f6e922a5ad57f7303fa78234e2a080eef7e4d8adebb3cd6e1c92"}, "3": {"node_id": "ba9b5e4b-990d-4433-9b23-e19b0268540f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "103", "file_name": "pfizer_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "7f921c184bab09a247f8312954224fd1c4077cefe251d4f31f774e14ca79318c"}}, "hash": "b2dfeaef6db41697b0849d02584494ed12cdf2b216192d4cc09c8fa881d6b0fc", "text": "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\nAdditionally, in September 2020,\u2009we received a Civil Investigative Demand (CID) from the Texas Attorney General\u2019s office\u2009seeking records of a similar nature to those requested by the\nSDNY.

Guarantees and Indemnifications\nIn the ordinary course of business and in connection with the sale of assets and businesses and other transactions, we often indemnify our counterparties against certain liabilities that may\narise in connection with the transaction or that are related to events and activities prior to or following a transaction. If the indemnified party were to make a successful claim pursuant to the\nterms of the indemnification, we may be required to reimburse the loss.

Insurance\nOur insurance coverage reflects market conditions (including cost and availability) existing at the time it is written, and our decision to obtain insurance coverage or to self-insure varies\naccordingly. Depending upon the cost and availability of insurance and the nature of the risk involved, the amount of self-insurance may be significant. The cost and availability of coverage\nhave resulted in self-insuring certain exposures, including product liability. If we incur substantial liabilities that are not covered by insurance or substantially exceed insurance coverage and\nthat are in excess of existing accruals, there could be a material adverse effect on our cash flows or results of operations in the period in which the amounts are paid and/or accrued.\nNote 17.  Segment, Geographic and Other Revenue Information\nA. Segment Information\nWe regularly review our operating segments and the approach used by management to evaluate performance and allocate resources. We manage our commercial operations through two\noperating segments, Biopharma and PC1, which are each led by a single manager. Biopharma is the only reportable segment. Each operating segment has responsibility for its commercial\nactivities. Regional commercial organizations market, distribute and sell our products and are supported by global platform functions that are responsible for the research, development,\nmanufacturing and supply of our products and global corporate enabling functions. Biopharma receives its R&D services from WRDM and GPD. These services include IPR&D projects for\nnew investigational products and additional indications for in-line products. Each operating segment has a geographic footprint across developed and emerging markets. Our chief operating\ndecision maker uses the revenues and earnings of the operating segments, among other factors, for performance evaluation and resource allocation.\nAfter the organizational changes in the third quarter of 2022 (see Note 1A), the new commercial structure within Biopharma is designed to better support and optimize performance across\nthree broad customer groups:\n\u2022Primary Care consists of the former Internal Medicine and Vaccines product portfolios, products for COVID-19 prevention and treatment, and potential future mRNA and antiviral products.\n\u2022Specialty Care consists of the former Inflammation & Immunology, Rare Disease and Hospital (excluding Paxlovid) product portfolios.\n\u2022Oncology consists of the former Oncology product portfolio.\nOther Business Activities\u2013\u2013Includes the operating results of PC1 as well as certain pre-tax costs not allocated to our operating segment results, such as costs associated with:\n\u2022WRDM\u2013\u2013the R&D and Medical expenses managed by our WRDM organization, which is generally responsible for research projects for our Biopharma portfolio until proof-of-concept is\nachieved and then for transitioning those projects to the GPD organization for possible clinical and commercial development. R&D spending may include upfront and milestone payments\nfor intellectual property rights.

Of this amount, current contract terms provide for expected delivery of product with contracted revenue in 2023 and 2024, the timing and\nterms of which may be renegotiated. Remaining performance obligations are based on foreign exchange rates as of the end of our fiscal fourth quarter of 2022 and exclude arrangements\nwith an original expected contract duration of less than one year.\nDeferred Revenues\u2013\u2013Our deferred revenues primarily relate to advance payments received or receivable from various government or government sponsored customers in international\nmarkets for supply of Comirnaty. The deferred revenues related to Comirnaty total $2.5 billion as of December 31, 2022, with $2.4 billion and $77 million recorded in current liabilities and\nnoncurrent liabilities, respectively. The deferred revenues related to Comirnaty totaled $3.3 billion as of December 31, 2021, with $3.0 billion and $249 million recorded in current liabilities\nand noncurrent liabilities, respectively. The decrease in Comirnaty deferred revenues during 2022 was primarily the result of amounts recognized in Revenues as we delivered the product\nto our customers and the impact of foreign exchange, partially offset by additional advance payments received as we entered into new or amended contracts. During 2022, we recognized\nrevenue of $3.1 billion that was included in the balance of Comirnaty deferred revenues as of December 31, 2021. The Comirnaty deferred revenues as of December 31, 2022 will be\nrecognized in Revenues proportionately as we transfer control of the product to our customers and satisfy our performance obligation under the contracts, with the amounts included in\ncurrent liabilities expected to be recognized in Revenues within the next 12 months, and the amounts included in noncurrent liabilities expected to be recognized in Revenues in 2024.\nDeferred revenues associated with contracts for other products were not significant as of December 31, 2022 or 2021.V600E/K \n\u00ae (d) V600E\nV600E/K\n(a)\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n(d) \u00ae\nPfizer Inc. 2022 Form 10-K 100", "start_char_idx": 3249, "end_char_idx": 5673, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5039686c-318c-4c73-9e95-64b4fe7e35a6": {"__data__": {"id_": "5039686c-318c-4c73-9e95-64b4fe7e35a6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "108", "file_name": "pfizer_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "data\\pfizer_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf_part_107", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "108", "file_name": "pfizer_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "92c46cd2806f56d03578264f88617f64e53ffc9ce5d5d0af8b8a93ca2d3d6301"}}, "hash": "92c46cd2806f56d03578264f88617f64e53ffc9ce5d5d0af8b8a93ca2d3d6301", "text": "ITEM 9.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective\ninternal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring\nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company\nas of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended\nDecember 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 23, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on those\nconsolidated financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial\nreporting, included in the accompanying Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control\nover financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with\nthe U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether\neffective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal\ncontrol over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the\nassessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our\nopinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial\nstatements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures\nthat (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable\nassurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and\nexpenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding\nprevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are\nsubject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n \nNew York, New York\nFebruary 23, 2023\nPfizer Inc. 2022 Form 10-K 102", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4379, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "90368032-388a-4b0c-8a68-82919ce9fd55": {"__data__": {"id_": "90368032-388a-4b0c-8a68-82919ce9fd55", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "110", "file_name": "pfizer_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "data\\pfizer_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf_part_109", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "110", "file_name": "pfizer_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "838751ab260812a00619fbfafd3669039e5867cb07971a0425df6af7a4aba901"}}, "hash": "838751ab260812a00619fbfafd3669039e5867cb07971a0425df6af7a4aba901", "text": "Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement\u2019 s Report\nWe prepared and are responsible for the financial statements that appear in this Form 10-K.

The description of our common stock is subject to and qualified in its entirety by\nreference to our restated certificate of incorporation (the Certificate of Incorporation), and our bylaws, as amended (the Bylaws), and the description of the notes is subject to and qualified in\nits entirety by reference to the base indenture (as defined below) and the ninth supplemental indenture (as defined below), each of which are incorporated by reference as an exhibit to the\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K of which this Exhibit 4.24 is a part. We encourage you to read our Certificate of Incorporation, our Bylaws, the applicable provisions of the Delaware General\nCorporation Law (the DGCL), the base indenture and the ninth supplemental indenture for additional information.

The common stock is not redeemable, does not have\nany conversion rights and is not subject to call. Holders of shares of common stock have no preemptive rights to maintain their percentage of ownership in future offerings or sales of our\nstock. Holders of shares of common stock have one vote per share in all elections of Directors and on all other matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders. The holders of common\nstock are entitled to receive dividends, if any, as and when may be declared from time to time by our Board of Directors, out of funds legally available therefor. Upon liquidation, dissolution\nor winding up of our affairs, the holders of common stock will be entitled to participate equally and ratably, in proportion to the number of shares held, in our net assets available for\ndistribution to holders of common stock. The shares of common stock currently outstanding are fully paid and nonassessable. The common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange\nunder the trading symbol \u201cPFE.\u201d\nPreferred Stock\nUnder the Certificate of Incorporation, we are authorized to issue up to 27 million shares of preferred stock, without par value. The preferred stock may be issued in one or more series, and\nthe Board of Directors of Pfizer is expressly authorized (i) to fix the descriptions, powers, preferences, rights, qualifications, limitations, and restrictions with respect to any series of preferred\nstock and (ii) to specify the number of shares of any series of preferred stock.\nAnti-takeover Effects of the Certificate of Incorporation, By-laws and Delaware Law\nCertificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. Various provisions contained in the Certificate of Incorporation and the Bylaws could delay or discourage some transactions involving an actual or\npotential change in control of us or a change in our management and may limit the ability of our stockholders to remove current management or approve transactions that our stockholders\nmay deem to be in their best interests.

In general, an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d is any\nentity or person beneficially owning 15% or more of the corporation\u2019s outstanding voting stock, and any entity or person affiliated with or controlling or controlled by such entity or person.\nSection 203 makes it more difficult for an interested stockholder to effect various business combinations with a corporation for a three-year period. This statute could prohibit or delay\nmergers or other takeover or change in control attempts not approved in advance by our Board of Directors, and, as a result, could discourage attempts to acquire us, which could depress\nthe market price of our common stock.\nDESCRIPTION OF DEBT SECURITIES\nReference should be made to the indenture dated as of January 30, 2001, between Pfizer and The Bank of New York Mellon (formerly known as The Bank of New York), as successor to\nJPMorgan Chase Bank (formerly known as The Chase Manhattan Bank), as trustee, which we refer to as the \u201cbase indenture,\u201d as supplemented by the ninth supplemental indenture dated\nas of March 6, 2017, among Pfizer Inc., The Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee, and The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch, as paying agent, which we refer to as the \u201cninth\nsupplemental indenture.\u201d When we refer to the \u201cindenture,\u201d we mean the base indenture, as supplemented by the ninth supplemental indenture. The following description is a summary of\nselected portions of the base indenture and the ninth supplemental indenture. It does not restate the base indenture or the ninth supplemental indenture, and those documents, not this\ndescription, define the rights of a holder of the notes.\nPrincipal, Maturity and Interest\nThe notes were limited to \u20ac750,000,000 aggregate principal amount. The notes will mature on March 6, 2027. We issued the notes in denominations of \u20ac100,000 and in integral multiples of\n\u20ac1,000 in excess thereof.\nInterest on the notes accrues at the annual rate of 1.000%. Interest on the notes is payable on March 6 of each year. Interest on the notes is computed on the basis of the actual number of\ndays in the period for which interest is being calculated and the actual number of days from and including the last date on which interest was paid on the notes to, but excluding, the next\nscheduled interest payment date. This payment convention is referred to as ACTUAL/ACTUAL (ICMA) (as defined in the rulebook of the International Capital Market Association).\nWe make each interest payment to the holders of record of the notes at the close of business on the 15th calendar day (whether or not a business day) preceding the relevant interest\npayment date.\nThe Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch, acts as our paying agent with respect to the notes. Upon notice to the trustee, we may change any paying agent. Payments of principal,\ninterest and premium, if any, will be made by us through the paying agent to Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V. (the \u201cEuroclear Operator\u201d), as operator of the Euroclear System (\u201cEuroclear\u201d) and/or\nClearstream Banking, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme, Luxembourg (\u201cClearstream\u201d) as described under \u201c\u2014Book-Entry.\u201d\nIssuance in", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3809, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e534def9-3d4c-46b0-9f99-b7848b2f0d28": {"__data__": {"id_": "e534def9-3d4c-46b0-9f99-b7848b2f0d28", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "118", "file_name": "pfizer_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "data\\pfizer_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf_part_117", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "118", "file_name": "pfizer_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "35c6ed253f960489700fc05b63664b280758c9e5401788b1f891412afb942708"}, "2": {"node_id": "de68c2e6-5ae1-4ea6-8b6e-d33224a27ee0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "118", "file_name": "pfizer_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "719b3ce092a991ff11225eaf2c3d7a73ed9939d1dd2b73c68772970ab15202ba"}}, "hash": "4ea1db89676e3bf75353c0cbd7c241869eb16e4005f59c5d8d031eb0ab6f7e13", "text": "as described under \u201c\u2014Book-Entry.\u201d\nIssuance in Euros\nPrincipal, premium, if any, and interest payments and additional amounts, if any, in respect of the notes are payable in euros.\nIf the euro is unavailable to us due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond our control or the euro is no longer used by the then member states of the\nEuropean Monetary Union that have adopted the euro as their currency or for the settlement of transactions by public institutions within the international banking community, then all\npayments in respect of the notes will be made in U.S. dollars until the euro is again available to us or so used. In such circumstances, the amount payable on any date in euros will be\nconverted to U.S. dollars on the basis of the most recently available market exchange rate for euros, as determined by us in our sole discretion. Any payment in respect of the notes so\nmade in U.S. dollars does not constitute an event of default under the indenture or the notes.

Clearstream interfaces with domestic markets in several countries.\n\u2022 Clearstream has established an electronic bridge with the Euroclear Operator to facilitate the settlement of trades between the nominees of Clearstream and Euroclear.\n\u2022 As a registered bank in Luxembourg, Clearstream is subject to regulation by the Luxembourg Commission for the Supervision of the Financial Sector.\n\u2022 Clearstream customers are recognized financial institutions around the world, including underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations\nand certain other organizations and may include the underwriters.

All operations are conducted by the Euroclear Operator, and all Euroclear securities clearance accounts and Euroclear cash\naccounts are accounts with the Euroclear Operator.\n\u2022 Securities clearance accounts and cash accounts with the Euroclear Operator are governed by the Terms and Conditions Governing Use of Euroclear and the related operating\nprocedures of Euroclear, and applicable Belgian law (collectively, the \u201cTerms and Conditions\u201d). The Terms and Conditions govern transfers of securities and cash within Euroclear,\nwithdrawals of securities and cash from Euroclear, and receipts of payments with respect to securities in Euroclear. All securities in Euroclear are held on a fungible basis without\nattribution of specific certificates to specific securities clearance accounts. The Euroclear Operator acts under the Terms and Conditions only on behalf of Euroclear participants,\nand has no records of or relationship with persons holding through Euroclear participants.\n\u2022 Euroclear participants include banks (including central banks), securities brokers and dealers and other professional financial intermediaries and may include the underwriters.\nIndirect access to Euroclear is also available to other firms that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear participant, either directly or indirectly.\nDistributions with respect to the notes held beneficially through Euroclear will be credited to the cash accounts of Euroclear participants in accordance with the Terms and Conditions.\n- 6 -", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4286, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "65d01009-b88b-4f74-bab4-1f36ef114413": {"__data__": {"id_": "65d01009-b88b-4f74-bab4-1f36ef114413", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "123", "file_name": "pfizer_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "data\\pfizer_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf_part_122", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "123", "file_name": "pfizer_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "c612b64191046915f348a32b26a4e1a2b810e144d7c48e1dc731afc889790c86"}, "3": {"node_id": "7266de24-425f-49ef-9060-80c0dbb80cbc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "123", "file_name": "pfizer_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "69711e73683b8982a6b9126ebef0cee5fadd3d190f2410c197724fe8355f3aae"}}, "hash": "8c3cb18a12beb60c49c2a72fb5547517fe420c9d568782b0853e97d667727631", "text": "Euroclear and Clearstream Arrangements\nSo long as Euroclear or Clearstream or their nominee or their common depositary is the registered holder of the global notes representing the notes, Euroclear, Clearstream or such\nnominee, as the case may be, will be considered the sole owner or holder of the notes represented by such global notes for all purposes under the indenture and the notes. Payments of\nprincipal, interest and additional amounts, if any, in respect of the global notes representing the notes are made to Euroclear, Clearstream, such nominee or such common depositary, as the\ncase may be, as registered holder thereof. Neither Pfizer nor the trustee, or any affiliate of any of the above or any person by whom any of the above is controlled (as such term is defined in\nthe Securities Act) has any responsibility or liability for any records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in the global notes representing the notes or\nfor maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests.\nDistributions of principal, premium, if any, and interest with respect to the global notes representing the notes are credited in euros to the extent received by Euroclear or Clearstream from\nthe paying agent to the cash accounts of Euroclear or Clearstream customers in accordance with the relevant system\u2019s rules and procedures.\nBecause Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants, the ability of a person having an interest in the global notes\nrepresenting the notes to pledge such interest to persons or entities which do not participate in the relevant clearing system, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be\naffected by the lack of a physical certificate in respect of such interest.\nSecondary Market Trading\nBecause the purchaser determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the time of trading of any notes where both the purchaser\u2019s and seller\u2019s accounts are located to ensure\nthat settlement can be made on the desired value date.\nWe understand that secondary market trading between Clearstream and/or Euroclear participants occurs in the ordinary way following the applicable rules and operating procedures of\nClearstream and Euroclear. Secondary market trading is settled using procedures applicable to conventional eurobonds in global registered form.\nThe holder of the notes should be aware that investors are only able to make and receive deliveries, payments and other communications involving the notes through Clearstream and\nEuroclear on days when those systems are open for business. Those systems may not be open for business on days when banks, brokers and other institutions are open for business in the\nUnited States.\nIn addition, because of time-zone differences, there may be problems with completing transactions involving Clearstream and Euroclear on the same business day as in the United States.\nU.S. investors who wish to transfer their interests in the notes, or to make or receive a payment or delivery of the notes, on a particular day, may find that the transactions are not performed\nuntil the next business day in Luxembourg or Brussels, depending on whether Clearstream or Euroclear is used.\nClearstream or Euroclear credits payments to the cash accounts of Clearstream customers or Euroclear participants, as applicable, in accordance with the relevant system\u2019s rules and\nprocedures, to the extent received by its depositary. Clearstream or the Euroclear Operator, as the case may be, takes any other action permitted to be taken by a holder under the\nindenture on behalf of a Clearstream customer or Euroclear participant only in accordance with its relevant rules and procedures.\nClearstream and Euroclear have agreed to the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of the notes among participants of Clearstream and Euroclear.

The\nCommittee may amend the terms of any Award heretofore granted, prospectively or retroactively, in order to cure any potential defects under Section 409A, in a manner deemed\nappropriate by the Committee in its sole and absolute discretion, without the consent of the Participant. Nothing in this Section 10 shall be construed as an admission that any of the\ncompensation and/or benefits payable under this Plan constitutes \u201cdeferred compensation\u201d subject to Section 409A. Furthermore, the Company does not represent, covenant or\nguarantee that any particular Award made under the Plan will be exempt from Section 409A and/or will avoid unfavorable tax consequences to the Participant (e.g., Section 409A\npenalties).\n(b)For Participants located outside of the United States, local country rules on taxation and withholding treatment will apply.\nSECTION 11. RECOUPMENT\nIn the event of a significant restatement of the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements (other than a restatement resulting from a change in accounting principles), the Committee\nwill review Awards made under the Plan for performance for the fiscal periods affected by the restatement. If the Committee determines that an Award would have been lower (or would\nnot have been made) if it had been based on the restated results, the Committee may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, seek recoupment of all or any portion of such Award as it\ndeems appropriate, in its sole and absolute discretion, after a review of all relevant facts and circumstances. Any recoupment may be in addition to any other remedies that may be\navailable to the Company under applicable law. Nothing contained in this paragraph will limit the Company\u2019s ability to seek recoupment, in appropriate circumstances and as permitted or\nrequired by applicable law (including Section 10D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended), of any amounts from any Employee, whether or not the Employee is a senior\nexecutive. If a Participant owes any outstanding debt, including but not limited to loans, vacation and salary and expense advances, to the Company or any Affiliates, any Award payable\nto the Participant under this Plan, to the extent such amount is exempt from Section 409A, shall be reduced by the full amount of such debt, as permitted by law.\nSECTION 12.
