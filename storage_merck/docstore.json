However, the introduction of new products and processes by competitors may result in price reductions and product displacements, even for products\nprotected by patents. For example, the number of compounds available to treat a particular disease typically increases over time and can result in slowed sales growth or\nreduced sales for the Company\u2019 s products in that therapeutic category .\nThe highly competitive animal health business is affected by several factors including regulatory and legislative issues, scientific and technological advances,\nproduct innovation, the quality and price of the Company\u2019 s products as well as competitors\u2019  products, effective promotional efforts and the frequent introduction of generic\nproducts by competitors.\nHealth Care Environment and Government Regulation\nGlobal efforts toward health care cost containme nt continue to exert pressure on product pricing and market access. Changes to the U.S. health care system as\npart of health care reform enacted in prior years, as well as increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of Medicare, Medicaid, and private sector\nbeneficiaries, have contributed to pricing pressu re. In several international markets, government-mandated pricing actions have reduced prices of generic and patented\ndrugs. In addition, the Company\u2019 s sales performance in 2022 was negatively affected by other  cost-reduction measures taken by governments and other third parties to\nlower health  care costs. In the U.S., the Biden Administration and Congress continue to discuss legislation designed to control health care costs, including the cost of drugs.\nThe Company anticipates all of these actions and additional actions in the future will continue to negatively af fect sales and profits.\nUnited States\nThe Compa ny faces increasing pricing pressure from managed care organizations, government agencies and programs that could negatively affect the\nCompany\u2019 s sales and profit margins, including, through (i) practices of managed care organizations, federal and state exchanges, and institutional and governmental\npurchasers, and (ii) federal laws and regulations  related to Medicare and Medicaid, including the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003,\nthe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA), the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (American Rescue Plan Act), and the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022\n(Inflation Reduction Act).\nIn the U.S., federal and state governments for many years have pursued methods to reduce the cost of drugs and vaccines for which they pay. For example,\nfederal and state laws require the Company to pay specified rebates for medicines reimbursed by Medicaid and to provide discounts for medicines purchased by certain\nstate and federal entities such as the Department of Defense, Veterans Affairs, Public Health Service entities and hospitals serving a disproportionate share of low income\nor uninsured patients.\nAdditionally in the U.S., consolidation and integration among health care providers is a major factor in the competitive marketplace for pharmaceutical products.\nHealth plans and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) have been consolidating into fewer , larger  entities, thus enhancing their purchasing strength and importance. Private\nthird-party insurers, as well as governments, employ formularies to control costs by negotiating discounted prices in exchange for formulary inclusion. Failure to obtain\ntimely or adequate pricing or formulary placeme nt for Merck\u2019 s products or obtaining such placement at unfavorable pricing could adversely affect revenue. In addition to\nformulary tier co-pay differentials, private health insurance companies and self-insured employers have been increasing the cost-sharing required from beneficiaries,\nparticularly for branded pharmaceuticals and biotechnology products.

Many experts and analysts, both within the industry and outside, have predicted that the law will harm\ninnovation in the pharmaceutical industry and result in fewer new treatments being developed and approved over time. Merck is working to mitigate the potentially harmful\neffects that the law could have on innovation.\nIn addition, in 2021, Congress passed the American Rescue Plan Act, which included a provision that eliminates the statutory cap on rebates drug\nmanufacturers pay to Medicaid beginning in January 2024. These rebates act as a discount off the list price and eliminating the cap means that manufacturer discounts paid\nto Medicaid can increase. Prior to this change, manufacturers have not been required to pay more than 100% of the Average Manufacturer Price (AMP) in rebates to state\nMedicaid programs for Medicaid-covered drugs. As a result of this provision, beginning in 2024, it is possible that manufacturers may have to pay state Medicaid programs\nmore in rebates than they received on sales of particular products. This change could present a risk to Merck in the future for drugs that have high Medicaid utilization and\nrebate exposure that is more than 100% of the AMP.\nThe Compan y also faces increasing pricing pressure in the states, which are looking to exert greater influence over the price of prescription drugs. A number of\nstates have passed pharmaceutical price and cost transparency laws. These laws typically require manufacturers to report certain product price information or other\nfinancial data to the state. Some laws also require manufacturers to provide advance notification of price increases. The Company expects that states will continue their\nfocus on pharmaceutical pricing and will increasingly shift to more aggressive price control tools such as Prescription Drug Affordability Boards that have the authority to\nconduct af fordability reviews and establish upper payment limits.\nRegulatory Changes\nIn Novembe r 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General issued a Final Rule that would have, effective January 1, 2023,\neliminated the Anti-Kickb ack Statute safe harbor for rebates paid to Medicare Part D plans or to PBMs on behalf of such plans. Congress has delayed implementation of\nthis Final Rule until January 1, 2026 and pending federal legislation would repeal it entirely . While the Company cannot anticipate the effects of this change to the way it\ncurrently contracts, this new framework could significantly alter the way it does business with Part D Plan Sponsors and PBMs on behalf of such plans. This rulemaking also\nestablished, effective January 1, 2021, a new safe harbor for point of sale discounts at the pharmacy counter and a new safe harbor for certain service arrangements\nbetween pharmaceutical manufacturers and PBMs.\nThe pharmaceutical industry also could be considered a potential source of savings via other legislative and administrative proposals that have been debated\nbut not enacted. These types of revenue generating or cost saving proposals include additional direct price controls.\nEuropean Union\nEfforts towar d health care cost containment remain intense in the European Union (EU). The Company faces competitive pricing pressure resulting from generic\nand biosimilar drugs. In addition, a majority of countries in the EU attempt to contain drug costs by engaging in reference pricing in which authorities examine pre-\ndetermined markets for published prices of drugs. Reference pricing may either compare a product\u2019 s prices in other markets (external reference pricing), or compare a\nproduct\u2019 s price with those of other products in a national class (internal reference pricing). The authorities then use the price data to set new local prices for brand-name\ndrugs, includ ing the Company\u2019 s drugs.

Ultimately , HTA measures the added value of a new health technology compared to existing ones. The outcome of HTAs regarding specific\npharmaceutical products will often influence the pricing and reimbursement status granted to these pharmaceutical products by the regulatory authorities of individual EU\nMember States. A negative HTA of one of the Company\u2019 s products may mean that the product is not reimbursable or may force the Company to reduce its reimbursement\nprice or of fer discounts or rebates.\nA negative HTA by a leading and recognized HTA body could also undermine the Company\u2019 s ability to obtain reimbursement for the relevant product outside a\njurisdiction. For example, EU Member States that have not yet developed HTA mechanisms may rely to some extent on the HTA performed in other countries with a\ndeveloped HTA framework, to inform their pricing and reimbursement decisions. HTA procedures  require additional data, reviews and administrative processes, all of which\nincrease the complexity , timing and costs of obtaining product reimbursement and exert downward pressure on available reimbursement.\nTo obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some EU Member States, the Company may be required to conduct studies that compare the cost-ef fectiveness\nof the Company\u2019 s produ ct candidates to other therapies that are considered the local standard of care.

In addition, if a Merck product has the same medical action or composition of another product that is subject to market expansion re-pricing, the Merck product\ncould also be subject to re-pricing unless it meets exception criteria.

In recent years, the Chinese governme nt has introduced and implemented a number of structural reforms to accelerate the shift to innovative products and reduce\ncosts. Since  2017, there have been multiple new policies introduced by the government to improve access to new innovation, reduce the complexity of regulatory filings,\nand accelerate the revie w and approval process . This has led to a significant increase in the number of new products being approved each year. While the mechanism for\ndrugs being added to the government\u2019 s National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL) evolves, inclusion may require a price negotiation which could impact the outlook in the\nmarket for selected brands.

The Merck Patient Assistance Program provides certain medicines and adult vaccines for free to people in the\nU.S. who do not have prescription drug or health insurance coverage and who, without the Company\u2019 s assistance, cannot afford their Merck medicines and vaccines.\nGlobally , Merck has made substantial contribut ions to access to health through key initiatives, including product donations for humanitarian assistance in low-income\ncountries through the Medical Outreach Program . The Mectizan Donation Program, the longest running disease-specific drug donation program of its kind, supports the\nelimination of two neglected tropical diseases \u2013 onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis. Additionally , through Merck for Mothers the Company provides funding, and\nscientific and business acumen to help global health partners end preventable deaths from complications of pregnancy and childbirth. Merck has also provided funds to the\nMerck Foundation, an independent grantmaking organization, which supports a variety of organizations dedicated to addressing systemic barriers to health equity .\nPrivacy and Data Protection\nThe Company is subject  to a significant number of privacy and data protection laws and regulations globally , many of which place restrictions on the Company\u2019 s\nability to transfer , access  and use personal data across its business. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve. There has\nbeen increased attention to privacy and data protection issues in both developed and emerging markets with the potential to affect directly the Company\u2019 s business,\nincluding the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which imposes penalties of up to 4% of global revenue.\nThe GDPR and related implementing laws in individual EU Member States govern the collection and use of personal health data and other personal data in the\nEU. The GDPR increased responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that the Company processes. It also imposes a number of strict obligations and restrictions\non the ability to process (which includes collectio n, analysis and transfer of) personal data, including health data from clinical trials and adverse event reporting. The GDPR\nalso includes  requirements relating to the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals prior to processing their\npersonal data or personal health data, notification of data processing obligations to the natio nal data protection authorities, and the security and confidentiality of the\npersonal data. Further , the GDPR prohibits the transfer of personal data to countries outside of the EU that are not considered by the EC to provide an adequate level of\ndata protect ion, includin g to the U.S., except if the data controller meets very specific requirements. Following the Schrems II decision of the Court of Justice of the EU in\n2020, there is considera ble uncertainty as to the permissibility of international data transfers under the GDPR. In light of the implications of this decision, the Company may\nface difficulties regardin g the transfer of personal data from the EU to third countries. Since then, the Company diligently entered into the EU-approved Standard\nContractual Clauses with its vendors, suppliers, collaboration partners and clinical trial sites in order to facilitate the lawful transfer of personal data from the EU to the U.S.\nIn addition, President Biden issued an Executive Order on October 7, 2022 to address the data privacy concerns raised in the Schrems II decision through introducing,\namong other measures, further safeguards and oversight of personal data collection by U.S. signals intelligence activities and providing individuals with a redress\nmechanism in the U.S. for their data protection concerns.

Current U.S. patent law provides\nadditional patent term for periods when the patented product was under regulatory review by the FDA.

At December 31, 2022, approximately 19,200 people were employed in the Company\u2019 s research activities. The Company prioritizes its research and development\nefforts and focuses on candidates that it believes represent breakthrough science for unmet medical needs that will make a dif ference for patients and payers.\nThe Compan y maintains a number of long-term exploratory and fundamental research programs  in biology and chemistry as well as research programs directed\ntoward product development. The Company\u2019 s research and development model is designed to increase productivity and improve the probability of success by prioritizing\nthe Compan y\u2019s research and development resou rces on candidates the Company believes are capable of providing unambiguous, promotable advantages to patients and\npayers and delivering the maximum value of its approved medicines and vaccines through new indications and new formulations. Merck is pursuing emerging product\nopportunities independent of therapeutic area or modality (small molecule, biologics and vaccines) and is building its biologics capabilities. The Company is committed to\nensuring that externally sourced programs remain an important component of its pipeline strategy , with a focus on supplementing its internal research through acquisitions\nas well as a licensing and external alliance strate gy focused on the entire spectrum of collaborati ons from early research to late-stage compounds, as well as access to new\ntechnologies.\nThe Company\u2019 s clinical pipeline includes candidates in multiple disease areas, including cancer , cardiovascular diseases, metabolic diseases, infectious\ndiseases, neurosciences, respiratory diseases, and vaccines.\nIn the development of human health products, industry practice and government regulations in the U.S. and most foreign countries provide for the determination\nof effectiveness and safety of new chemical compounds through preclinical tests and controlled  clinical evaluation. Before a new drug or vaccine may be marketed in the\nU.S., recorded data on preclinical and clinical experience are included in the New Drug Applicatio n (NDA) for a drug or the Biologics License Application (BLA) for a vaccine\nor biologic submitted to the FDA  for the required approval.\nOnce the Company\u2019 s scientists discover a new small molecule compound or biologic that they believe has promise to treat a medical condition, the Company\ncommences preclinical testing with that compou nd. Preclinical testing includes laboratory testing and animal safety studies to gather data on chemistry , pharmacology ,\nimmunogenicity and toxicology . Pending acceptable preclinical data, the Company will initiate clinical testing in accordance with established regulatory requirements. The\nclinical testing begins with Phase 1 studies, which are designed to assess safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics, and preliminary pharmacodynamic activity of the compound\nin humans. If favorable, additional, larger Phase  2 studies are initiated to determine the efficacy of the compound in the affected population, define appropriate dosing for\nthe compoun d, as well as identify any adverse effects that could limit the compound\u2019 s usefulne ss. In some situations, the clinical program incorporates adaptive design\nmethodology to use accumulating data to decide how to modify aspects of the ongoing clinical study as it continues, without undermining the validity and integrity of the trial.\nOne type of adaptive clinical trial is an adaptive Phase 2a/2b trial design, a two-stage trial design consisting of a Phase 2a proof-of-concept stage and a Phase 2b dose-\noptimization finding stage. If data from the Phase 2 trials are satisfactory , the Company comm ences large-scale Phase 3 trials to confirm the compound\u2019 s efficacy and\nsafety . Another type of adaptive clinical trial is an adaptive Phase 2/3 trial design, a study that includes an interim analysis and an adaptation that changes the trial from\nhaving featu res common  in a Phase 2 study (e.g., multiple dose groups) to a design", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4269, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0fbad39c-e59a-4540-94b0-eeb5d3494c39": {"__data__": {"id_": "0fbad39c-e59a-4540-94b0-eeb5d3494c39", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "merck_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "data\\merck_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf_part_15", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "merck_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "99ffb6e7cb2b75eb8c3646afaf993c988145dc47731181cf62b85ea9299c176d"}, "2": {"node_id": "aa08c2fd-7184-485b-bf03-a927978b7e45", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "merck_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "8cb26c83e3cfe05ecfce84b1bd97c3372917c08da5104ea51c6a749aed510e76"}}, "hash": "bfc135eba665a1f3b3a56cf236b463d246130e8fa64f4199117b14b7bf675c3d", "text": "res common  in a Phase 2 study (e.g., multiple dose groups) to a design similar to a Phase 3 trial. An adaptive Phase 2/3 trial design reduces timelines by\neliminating activities which would be required to start a separate study . Upon completion of Phase 3 trials, if satisfactory , the Company submits regulatory filings with the\nappropriate regulatory agencies around the world to have the product candidate approved for marketing. There can be no assurance that a compound that is the result of\nany particular program will obtain the regulatory approvals necessary for it to be marketed.\nVaccine development follows the same general pathway as for drugs. Preclinical testing focuses  on the vaccine\u2019 s safety and ability to elicit a protective immune\nresponse (immunogenicity). Pre-marketing vaccine clinical trials are typically done in three phases. Initial Phase 1 clinical studies are conducted in normal subjects to\nevaluate the safety , tolerability and immunoge nicity of the vaccine candidate. Phase 2 studies are dose-ranging studies and provide additional data on safety ,\nimmunogenicity and/or effectiveness. Finally , Phase 3 trials are conducted in the intended population for licensure and provide data on immunogenicity and/or effectiveness,\nas well as safety , to support applications for regulatory approvals. If successful, the Company submits regulatory filings with the appropriate regulatory agencies.\nIn the U.S., the FDA review process begins once a complete NDA or BLA is submitted, received and accepted for review by the agency .

Once the review timelines are determined,\nthe FDA will generally act upon the application within those timelines, unless a major amendme nt has been submitted (either at the Company\u2019 s own initiative or the FDA\u2019s\nrequest) to the pending application. If this occurs, the FDA may extend the review period to allow for review of the new information, but by no more than three months.\nExtensions to the review period are communica ted to the Company . The FDA can act on an application either by issuing an approval letter or by issuing a Complete\nResponse Letter (CRL) stating that the applicatio n will not be approved in its present form and describing all deficiencies that the FDA has identified. Should the Company\nwish to pursue an application after receiving a CRL, it can resubmit the application with information that addresses the questions or issues identified by the FDA in order to\nsupport approval. Resubmissions are subject to review period targets, which vary depending on the underlying submission type and the content of the resubmission.\nThe FDA has four program designations \u2014 Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy , Accelerated Approval, and Priority Review \u2014 to facilitate and expedite\ndevelopment and review of new drugs to addre ss unmet medical needs in the treatment of serious or life-threatening conditions. The Fast Track designation provides\npharmaceutical manufac turers with opportunities for frequent interactions with FDA reviewers during the product\u2019 s development and the ability for the manufacturer to do a\nrolling subm ission of the NDA/BLA. A rolling submission allows completed portions of the applic ation to be submitted and reviewed by the FDA on an ongoing basis. The\nBreakthrough Therapy designation provides manufacturers with all of the features of the Fast Track designation as well as intensive guidance on implementing an efficient\ndevelopment program for the product and a commitment by the FDA to involve senior managers and experienced staff in the review . The Accelerated Approval designation\nallows the FDA to approve a product based on an effect on a surrogate or intermediate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a product\u2019 s clinical benefit and generally\nrequires the manufacturer to conduct required post-approval confirmatory trials to verify the clinical benefit. The Priority Review designation means that the FDA\u2019s goal is to\ntake action on the NDA/BLA  within six months, compared to ten months under standard review . More than one of these special designations can be granted for a given\napplication (i.e., a product designated as a Breakthrough Therapy may also be eligible for Priority Review).\nDue to the COVID-19 public health crisis, the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services has exercised statutory authority to determine that a public health\nemergency exists, and declared these circumstances justify the emergency use of drugs and biological products as authorized by the FDA. While in effect, this declaration\nenables the FDA to issue Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) permitting distribution and use of specific medical products absent NDA/BLA  submission or approval,\nincluding products to treat or prevent diseases or conditions caused by the SARS-CoV -2 virus, subject to the terms of any such EUAs. The FDA must make certain findings\nto grant an EUA, including that it is reasonable to believe based on the totality of evidence that the drug or biologic may be effective, and that known or potential benefits\nwhen used under the terms of the EUA outweigh known or potential risks.

A company seeking to market an innovative pharmaceutical product through the centralized procedure must file a complete set of safety data and\nefficacy data as part of a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) with the European Medicines Agency (EMA). After the EMA  evaluates the MAA, it provides a\nrecommendation to the EC and the EC then approves or denies the MAA. It is also possible for new chemical products to obtain marketing authorization in the EU through a\n\u201cmutual recognition procedure\u201d in which an application is made to a single member state and, if the member state approves the pharmaceutical product under a national\nprocedure, the applicant may submit that approval to the mutual recognition procedure of some or all other EU Member States.\nOutside of the U.S. and the EU, the Company submits marketing applications to national regulatory authorities. Examples of such are the Ministry of Health,\nLabour and Welfare in Japan, the National Medical Products Administration in China, Health Canada, Ag\u00eancia Nacional de Vigil\u00e2ncia Sanat\u00e1ria in Brazil, Korea Food and\nDrug Administration in South Korea, and the Therapeutic Goods Administration in Australia. Each country has a separate and independent review process and timeline.

Merck is developing Lagevrio  in collaboration with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics  LP (Ridgeback). The FDA granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for\nLagevrio  in December 2021; last issued in February 2023, to authorize Lagevrio  for the treatment of adults with a current diagnosis of mild-to-moderate COVID-19, and who\nare at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death, and for whom alternative COVID-19 treatment options approved or authorized by the\nFDA are not accessible or clinically appropriate . The authorization is based on the Phase 3 MOVe-OUT  trial. Lagevrio  is not approved for any use in the U.S. and is\nauthorized only for the duration of the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authoriz ation of its emergency use under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, unless\nthe authorization is terminated or revoked sooner . In November 2021, the EMA  issued a positive scientific opinion for Lagevrio , which is intended to support national\ndecision-making on the possible use of Lagevrio  prior to marketing authorization. In October 2021, the EMA  initiated a rolling review for Lagevrio  for the treatment of\nCOVID-19 in adults. On February 24, 2023, Merck and Ridgeback announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the EMA  has\nrecommended the refusal of the marketing authorization for Lagevrio . Merck and Ridgeback will appeal the decision and request a re-examination of the CHMP\u2019 s opinion.\nApplications to other regulatory bodies worldwide are underway .\nIn October 2022, Merck provided an update on new clinical and non-clinical studies of Lagevrio . A prelimina ry analysis of the University of Oxford\u2019 s PANORAMIC\nstudy , condu cted in the UK in highly-vaccinated adults mostly over 65 years of age, showed no evidence of a difference between Lagevrio  added to usual care compared to\nusual care alone for the reduction of hospitalizati ons and deaths through Day 28 (primary endpoint was not met); the incidence of hospitalizations and death through Day 28\nwas very low overall. The main secondary endpoint (time to first self-reported recovery) in the PANORAMIC study was 6 days shorter with the Lagevrio  group compared to\nthe usual care group; in addition, the use of Lagevrio  also was associated with earlier recovery acros s a wide range of other symptom measures, as compared to the usual\ncare group. Additionally , an analysis of real-world  data from a separate study conducted by investigators in Israel (known as the Clalit study) showed that in a cohort of non-\nhospitalized, high-risk patients, Lagevrio  reduced hospitalizations and mortality due to COVID-19 in patients 65 years and above; no evidence of benefit was found in\nyounger adults ages 40 to 64 years. Also, Merck reported results from a separate, non-clinical 6-month carcinogenicity study in transgenic mice, which demonstrated that\nLagevrio  was not carcinogenic at any dose tested.\nMK-7264, gefapixant, is an investigational, orally administered, selective P2X3 receptor antagonist, for the treatment of refractory chronic cough or unexplained\nchronic cough in adults under review by the FDA and the EMA.

The Company has made progress\ntoward its climate goals and aspires to meet and exceed the evolving expectations of its stakeh olders and employees. These goals include achieving carbon neutrality for\ngreenhouse gas emissions across operations (Scopes 1 and 2) by 2025, reducing Scope 1 and 2 operational greenhouse gas emissions 46% by 2030 (from a 2019\nbaseline), reducing Scop e 3 greenhouse gas emissions by 30% by 2030 (from a 2019 baseline) , and sourcing 100% of its purchased electricity from renewables by 2025.\nOther environmental sustainability initiatives of the Company include:\n\u2022Low Carbon Transition Playbook . In 2021, the Company launched its Low Carbo n Transition Playbook, a tool intended to help create a site strategy by\nidentifying gaps, uncovering opportunities and creating a common platform for assessment of levers and resource deployment across a range of\nsustainability initiatives. It also details how employees and stakeholders can accelerate the Company\u2019 s environmental work, along with explanations of the\ncollective benefits of these actions for the business and for stakeholders. Functions across the Company are expected to take advantage of this document\nto strategize  and develop new ways to meet many of the Company\u2019 s broader sustainability goals and streamline the Company\u2019 s tracking and reporting of\nspecific metrics and categories.\n\u2022Waste Diversion Playbook . In 2022, the Company created its Waste Divers ion Playbook, which is a tool, similar to the Low Carbon Transition Playbook, to\nhelp sites self-assess and develop their waste diversion strategies to achieve the Company\u2019 s corporate waste goals. The objectives are to identify and\nprioritize the most ef fective and least resource intensive actions, improve tracking and reporting and generate knowledge sharing between sites.\n\u2022Partnering for progress across the Company\u2019 s value chain . The Comp any is a signatory to Schneider Electric\u2019 s Energize program, a pioneering\ncollaboration to help pharmaceutical and health care suppliers address their own operational Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions through green power\nprocurement, which in turn is intended to help the signatories reduce their Scope 3 emissions.\n\u2022Product stewardship and green and sustaina ble science.  The Compa ny\u2019s product stewardship program focuses on identifying and either preventing or\nminimizing potential safety and environmental hazards throughout a product\u2019 s life cycle. The Company is also committed to understanding, managing and\nreducing the environmental impacts of its products and the materials associated with discovering and producing them. The Company\u2019 s green and\nsustainable science program uses a \u201cgreen-by-design\u201d approach. By using more efficient and innovative processing methods and technologies, the\nCompany is reducing the amount of energy , water and raw materials the Company uses to make the Company\u2019 s products, thereby reducing the amount of\nwaste the Company generates and lowering the Company\u2019 s production costs.\nManagement does not believe that expenditures related to these initiatives should have a materia l adverse effect on the", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3997, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2ac30184-772f-4b5f-a022-a1740d873d31": {"__data__": {"id_": "2ac30184-772f-4b5f-a022-a1740d873d31", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "25", "file_name": "merck_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "data\\merck_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf_part_24", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "25", "file_name": "merck_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "5ba971ac08fb01cf5d7627504d0a0ac266709dd17266c083e7187f94882d8518"}, "2": {"node_id": "32d0bcca-972c-40d8-898d-f7f381d8826d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "25", "file_name": "merck_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "cfa5b27ffe16f945a95b6f936f0ce1fafae11baac208b22025d3c7b1a48fbe16"}}, "hash": "fc9e0a709a823850ef2819ac24c05354de861d4f98ac2edbed77947739093d13", "text": "related to these initiatives should have a materia l adverse effect on the Company\u2019 s financial condition, results of\noperations, liquidity or capital resources for any year .\nEnvironmental Regulation and Remediation\nThe Compan y believes that there are no compliance issues associated with applicable environmental laws and regulations that would have a material adverse\neffect on the Company .

Additional risks not currently known to the Company or that the Company presently deems immaterial\nmay also impair its busin ess operations. The Company\u2019 s business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow or prospects could be materially adversely affected\nby any of these risks. This Form 10-K also conta ins forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The Company\u2019 s results could materially differ from those\nanticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including the risks it faces described below and elsewhere. See \u201cCautionary Factors that May\nAffect Future Results\u201d below .\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019 s Business\nThe Company is depen dent on its patent rights, and if its patent rights are invalidated or circumvented, its business could be materially adversely\naffected.\nPatent prote ction is considered, in the aggregate , to be of material importance to the Company\u2019 s marketing of human health and animal health products in the\nU.S. and in most major foreign markets. Patents covering products that it has introduced normally  provide market exclusivity , which is important for the successful marketing\nand sale of its products. The Company seeks patents covering each of its products in each of the markets where it intends to sell the products and where meaningful patent\nprotection is available.\nEven if the Company succeeds in obtaining patents covering its products, third parties or government authorities may challenge or seek to invalidate or\ncircumvent its patents and patent applications. It is important for the Company\u2019 s business to successfully assert and defend the patent rights that provide market exclusivity\nfor its products. The Com pany is often involved in patent disputes relating to challenges to its patents or claims by third parties of infringement against the Company . The\nCompany asserts and defends its patents both within and outside the U.S., including by filing claims of infringement against other parties. See Item 8. \u201cFinancial Statements\nand Supplementary Data,\u201d Note 11. \u201cContingencies and Environmental Liabilities\u201d below . In particular , manufacturers of generic or biosimilar pharmaceutical products from\ntime to time file abbreviated NDAs or BLAs with the FDA seeking to market generic/biosimilar forms of the Company\u2019 s products prior to the expiration of relevant patents\nowned or licensed by the Company . The Compa ny normally responds by asserting one or more of its patents with a lawsuit alleging patent infringement. Patent litigation\nand other challenges to the Company\u2019 s patents are costly and unpredictable and may deprive the Company of market exclusivity for a patented product or, in some cases,\nthird-party patents may prevent the Company from marketing and selling a product in a particular geographic area.\nAdditionally , certain foreign governments have indicated that compulsory licenses to patents may be granted in the case of national emergencies or in other\ncircumstances, which could diminish or eliminate sales and profits from those regions and nega tively affect the Company\u2019 s results of operations.

However , certain of the rulings are currently being appealed, and an unfavorable court decision would likely cause the products to lose exclusivity in the U.S.\ntoward the end of 2023.  The Company lost market exclusivity for Januvia  in all of the EU and for Janumet  in some European coun tries in September 2022.

Such events could have a material adverse ef fect on the sales of any such products.\nIn particular , in 2022, sales of Lagevrio , which  were $5.7 billion, represented a substan tial portion of the Company\u2019 s revenue and profit growth.

The patent rights that protect its products are of varying strengths and\ndurations. In addition, in some countries, patent protection is significantly weaker than in the U.S. or in the EU. In the U.S. and the EU, political pressure to reduce spending\non prescription drugs has led to legislation and other measures that encourage the use of gene ric and biosimilar products. Although it is the Company\u2019 s policy to actively\nprotect its patent rights,  generic challenges to the Company\u2019 s products can arise at any time, and the Company\u2019 s patents may not prevent the emergence of generic\ncompetition for its products.\nLoss of patent protection  for a product typically is followed promptly by generic substitutes, reducing the Company\u2019 s sales of that product.

However , there is no guarantee that the Company\u2019 s efforts to expand sales in\nthese markets will succeed. Some countries within emerging markets may be especially vulnerable to periods of global financial instability or may have very limited\nresources to spend on health care. In order for the Company to successfully implement its emerging markets strategy , it must attract and retain qualified personnel. The\nCompany may also be required to increase its reliance on third-party agents within less develope d markets, which may affect its ability to realize continued growth and may\nalso increase the Comp any\u2019s risk exposure. In addition, many of these countries have curren cies that fluctuate substantially and, if such currencies devalue and the\nCompany cannot of fset the devaluations, the Company\u2019 s financial performance within such countries could be adversely af fected.\nThe Company\u2019 s business in China has grown rapidly in the past few years, and the importance of China to the Company\u2019 s overall pharmaceutical and vaccines\nbusiness outside the U.S. has increased accordingly . In addition to its commercial operations, the Company has significant research and manufacturing operations in China.\nIf geopolitica l tensions were to increase and disrupt the Company\u2019 s operations in China, such disruption could result in a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019 s product\ndevelopment, sales, business, cash flow , results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nAlso, continu ed growth of the Company\u2019 s business in China is dependent upon ongoing develop ment of a favorable environment for innovative pharmaceutical\nproducts and vaccines, sustained access for the Company\u2019 s currently marketed products, and the absence of trade impediments or adverse pricing controls. As noted\nabove in \u201cCompetition and the Health Care Environment,\u201d pricing pressure in China has increased as the Chinese government has been taking steps to reduce costs,\nincluding implementing health care reform that has led to the acceleration of generic substitution,  where available. While the mechanism for drugs being added to the NRDL\nevolves, inclusion may require a price negotiation which could impact the outlook in the mark et for selected brands. In 2021, drugs were added to the NRDL  with an\naverage of more than 60% price reductions. A new NRDL  was recently completed in which new entries averaged 60% price reductions. While pricing pressure has always\nexisted in China, health care reform has increased this pressure in part due to the acceleration of generic substitution through the government\u2019 s VBP program. In 2019, the\ngovernment implemente d the VBP program through a tendering process for mature products which have generic substitutes with a Generic Quality Consistency Evaluation\napproval. Mature products that have entered into the last five rounds of VBP had, on average, a price reduction of more than 50%. The Company expects VBP to be a\nsemi-annual process that will have a significant impact on mature products moving forward.\nFor all these reasons, sales within emerging markets carry significant risks. However , at the same time, macro economic growth of selected emerging markets is\nexpected to outpace Europe and even the U.S., leading to significant increased health care spending in those countries and access to innovative medicines for patients.

There are unique risks and uncertainties related to biologics and vaccines, including:\n\u2022There may be limited access to, and supply of, normal and diseased tissue samples, cell lines, pathogens, bacteria, viral strains and other biological\nmaterials. In addition, government regulations in multiple jurisdictions, such as the U.S. and the EU, could result in restricted access to, or transport or use\nof, such materials. If the Company loses access to sufficient sources of such materials, or if tighte r restrictions are imposed on the use of such materials, the\nCompany may not be able to conduct research activities as planned and may incur additional development costs.\n\u2022The development, manufacturing and marketing of biologics and vaccines are subject to regulation by the FDA, the EMA  and other regulatory bodies. These\nregulations are often more complex and extensive than the regulations applicable to other pharmaceutical products. For example, in the U.S., a BLA,\nincluding both preclinical and clinical trial data and extensive data regarding the manufacturing procedures, is required for human vaccine candidates, and\nFDA approval is generally required for the release of each manufactured commercial human vaccine lot.\n\u2022Manufacturing biologics and vaccines, especially in large quantities, is often complex and may require the use of innovative technologies to handle living\nmicro-organisms. Each lot of an approved biologic and vaccine must undergo thorough testing for identity , strength, quality , purity and potency .\nManufacturing biologics requires facilities specifically designed for and validated for this purpos e, and sophisticated quality assurance and quality control\nprocedures are necessary . Slight deviations anywhere in the manufacturing process, including filling, labeling, packaging, storage and shipping and quality\ncontrol and testing, may result in lot failures, product recalls or spoilage. When changes are made to the manufacturing process, the Company may be\nrequired to provide preclinical and clinical data showing the comparable identity , strength, quality, purity or potency of the products before and after such\nchanges.\n\u2022Biologics and vaccines are frequently costly to manufacture because production ingredients are derived from living animal or plant material, and most\nbiologics and vaccines cannot be made synthetically . In particular , keeping up with the demand for vaccines may be difficult due to the complexity of\nproducing vaccines.\n\u2022The use of biologically derived ingredients can lead to variability in the manufacturing process and could lead to allegations of harm, including infections or\nallergic reactions, which allegations would be reviewed through a standard investigation process that could lead to closure of product facilities due to\npossible contamination. Any of these events could result in substantial costs.\nRisks Relating to Government Regulation and Legal Proceedings\nThe health care industry in the U.S. has been, and will continue to be, subject to increasing regulation and political action.\nAs discussed above in \u201cCompetition and the Health Care Environment,\u201d the Company believes that the health care industry will continue to be subject to\nincreasing regulation as well as political and legal action, as future proposals to reform the health care system are considered by the Executive branch, Congress and state\nlegislatures.\nIn 2022, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act, which makes significant changes to how drugs are covered and paid for under the Medicare program,\nincluding the creation of financial penalties for drugs whose prices rise faster than the rate of inflation, redesign of the Medicare Part D program to require manufacturers to\nbear more of the liability for certain drug benefits, and government price-setting for certain Medicare Part D drugs, starting in 2026, and Medicare Part B drugs starting in\n2028.\nIn addition, in 2021, Congress passed the American Rescue Plan Act, which", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4389, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4957208b-e855-4657-9276-a4e40adf31bc": {"__data__": {"id_": "4957208b-e855-4657-9276-a4e40adf31bc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "36", "file_name": "merck_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "data\\merck_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf_part_35", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "36", "file_name": "merck_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "68d60393aa2f77955597920ba019c5a0849f7192a21eeb69be78c499a58c2b78"}, "2": {"node_id": "2f085a1f-3ad8-4b6e-9fc1-b794eab79eb0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "36", "file_name": "merck_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "4825862239f0f05fc3e2de629800ede32f82a307c2c94839404487f01d297aaf"}}, "hash": "03fd0a17e90c1b4d2bd76bd2e681c2908c5f12abeef8b9cf7d6409861f783a39", "text": "addition, in 2021, Congress passed the American Rescue Plan Act, which included a provision that eliminates the statutory cap on rebates drug\nmanufacturers pay to Medicaid beginning in January 2024.

Prior to this change, manufacturers have not been required to pay more than 100% of the Average Manufacturer Price (AMP) in rebates to state\nMedicaid programs for Medicaid-covered drugs. As a result of this provision, beginning in 2024, it is possible that manufacturers may have to pay state Medicaid programs\nmore in rebates than they received on sales of particular products.

In the U.S., the FDA administers requirements covering the testing, approval, safety , effectiveness, manufacturing, labeling and marketing of prescription\npharmaceuticals and vaccines. In some cases, the FDA requirements have increased the amount of time and resources necessary to develop new products and bring them\nto market in the U.S. Regulation outside the U.S. also is primarily focused on drug safety and effectiveness and, in many cases, reduction in the cost of drugs.

The\nCompany is subject to a substantial number of product liability claims. See Item 8. \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d Note 11. \u201cContingencies and\nEnvironmental Liabilities \u201d below for more information on the Company\u2019 s current product liability litigation. With respect to product liability , the Company self-insures\nsubstantially all of its risk, as the availability of commercial insurance has become more restrictive. The Company has evaluated its risks and has determined that the cost of\nobtaining product liability insurance outweighs the likely benefits of the coverage that is available and, as such, has no insurance for most product liabilities. The Company\nwill continually assess the most efficient means to address its risk; however , there can be no guarantee that insurance coverage will be obtained or, if obtained, will be\nsufficient to fully cover product liabilities that may arise.\nRisks Related to T echnology\nThe Compa ny is increasingly dependent on sophisticated software applications and computing infrastructure. The Company could be a target of\nfuture cyber-attacks that could lead to a disruption of its worldwide operations, including manufacturing, research and sales operations.\nThe Company is increasingly dependent on sophisticated software applications, complex information technology systems, computing infrastructure, and cloud\nservice providers (collec tively , IT systems) to conduct critical operations. Certain of these systems are managed, hosted, provided or used by third parties to assist in\nconducting the Company\u2019 s business. Disruption, degradation, or manipulation of these IT systems through intentional or accidental means by the Company\u2019 s employees,\nthird parties with authori zed access or unauthorized third parties could adversely affect key business processes. Cyber-attacks against the Company\u2019 s IT systems or third-\nparty providers\u2019  IT syste ms, such as cloud-base d systems, could result in exposure of confident ial information, the modification of critical data, and/or the failure of critical\noperations. Misuse of any of these IT systems could result in the disclosure of sensitive personal information or the theft of trade secrets, intellectual property , or other\nconfidential business information. The Company continues to leverage new and innovative technologies across the enterprise to replace outmoded technology and improve\nthe ef ficacy and ef ficiency of its business processes, including data acquisition; the use of which can create new risks.\nAlthough the aggregate impact of cyber-attacks and network disruptions on the Company\u2019 s operations and financial condition has not been material to date, the\nCompany continues to be a target of events of this nature and expects them to continue. The Company monitors its data, information technology and personnel usage of\nCompany IT systems to reduce these risks and continues to do so on an ongoing basis for any current or potential threats. There can be no assurance that the Company\u2019 s\nefforts to protect its data and IT systems or the efforts of third-party providers to protect their IT systems will be successful in preventing disruptions to the Company\u2019 s\noperations, including its manufacturing, research  and sales operations.

(Merck or the Company) is a global health care company that delivers innovative health solutions through its prescription medicines, including\nbiologic therapies, vaccines and animal health products. The Company\u2019 s operations are principally managed on a product basis and include two operating segments,\nPharmaceutical and Animal Health, both of which are reportable segments.\nThe Pharma ceutical segment includes human health pharmaceutical and vaccine products. Human health pharmaceutical products consist of therapeutic and\npreventive agents, generally sold by prescription, for the treatment of human disorders. The Com pany sells these human health pharmaceutical products primarily to drug\nwholesalers and retailers, hospitals, government  agencies and managed health care providers such as health maintenance organizations, pharmacy benefit managers and\nother institutions. Human health vaccine product s consist of preventive pediatric, adolescent and adult vaccines. The Company sells these human health vaccines primarily\nto physicians, wholesalers, physician distributors and government entities.\nThe Animal Health segment discovers, develops , manufactures and markets a wide range of veterinary pharmaceutical and vaccine products, as well as health\nmanagement solutions and services, for the prevention, treatment and control of disease in all major livestock and companion animal species. The Company also offers an\nextensive suite of digita lly connected identification, traceability and monitoring products. The Company sells its products to veterinarians, distributors, animal producers,\nfarmers and pet owners.\nSpin-Off of Organon & Co.\nOn June 2, 2021, Merck  completed the spin-of f of products from its women\u2019 s health, biosimilars and established brands businesses into a new, independent,\npublicly traded company named Organon & Co. (Organon) through a distribution of Organon\u2019 s publicly traded stock to Company shareholders. The distribution is expected\nto qualify and has been treated as tax-free to the Company and its shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The established brands included in the transaction\nconsisted of dermatology , non-opioid pain mana gement, respiratory , select cardiovascular products, as well as the rest of Merck\u2019 s diversified brands franchise. Merck\u2019 s\nexisting research pipelin e programs continue to be owned and developed within Merck as planned. The historical results of the businesses that were contributed to Organon\nin the spin-of f have been reflected as discontinued operations in the Company\u2019 s consolidated  financial statements through the date of the spin-of f (see Note 3 to the\nconsolidated financial statements).\n43", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3364, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a29ecb88-370f-4964-b415-d731ea2f36f5": {"__data__": {"id_": "a29ecb88-370f-4964-b415-d731ea2f36f5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "46", "file_name": "merck_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "data\\merck_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf_part_45", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "46", "file_name": "merck_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "02eca2a191911aa3968daec789c01734e0480be3b345b00d617651a8b9e3268c"}}, "hash": "02eca2a191911aa3968daec789c01734e0480be3b345b00d617651a8b9e3268c", "text": "Table of Contents\nOverview\nFinancial Highlights\n($ in millions except per share amounts) 2022 % Change% Change\nExcluding\nForeign\nExchange 2021 % Change% Change\nExcluding Foreign\nExchange 2020\nSales $ 59,283 22 % 26 %$ 48,704 17 % 16 %$ 41,518 \nNet Income from Continuing Operations Attributable to Merck &\nCo., Inc.:\nGAAP $ 14,519 18 % 21 %$ 12,345 * *$ 4,519 \nNon-GAAP $ 19,005 40 % 43 %$ 13,623 81 % 98 %$ 7,545 \nEarnings per Common Share Assuming Dilution from Continuing\nOperations Attributable to Merck & Co., Inc.

During 2022, the Company returned $7.0 billion to shareholders through dividends.\nGAAP and Non-GAAP EPS were negatively affected in 2022, 2021 and 2020 by $0.22, $0.65, and $1.56, respectively, of charges for certain upfront and pre-approval milestone payments related to collaborations and\nlicensing agreements, as well as charges related to pre-approval assets obtained in transactions accounted for as asset acquisitions.\nWar in Ukraine\nIn February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine. The Company\u2019 s primary concerns are the safety  and well-being of its employees and ensuring patients and\ncustomers have continue d access to medicines and vaccines needed for patient and public health. The Company is working cross-functionally across the globe to monitor\nand mitigate interruptions to business continuity resulting from the war, including its impact on Merck\u2019 s supply chain, operations and clinical trials. For humanitarian reasons,\nthe Company is continuing to supply essential medicines and vaccines in Russia while working to maintain compliance with international sanctions.

The Company does not have research or manufacturing facilities in Russia, currently does not plan to make\nfurther inves tments in Russia, and has suspende d screening and enrollment in ongoing clinical trials as well as planning for new studies in Russia, although the Company\ncontinues to treat patients already enrolled in existing clinical trials and collect data from these studies. The Company is also using its resources to help alleviate the\nhumanitarian crisis in Ukraine, including through donations of funds and products. The financial impacts of the war were immaterial to the Company\u2019 s consolidated financial\nstatements for 2022. Sales to Russia were approximately 1% of total Merck consolidated sales for 2022 and are expected to decline in future periods. The Company is\nunable to determine at this time the future direct or indirect impacts of this war on the Company\u2019 s business.\nCOVID-19\nAlthough COVID-19-rela ted disruptions had some negative effect on sales in 2022, Merck continues to believe that global health systems and patients have\nlargely adapted to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Merck\u2019 s revenue in 2022 benefited  from sales of Lagevrio , which were $5.7 billion. Merck expects sales of\nLagevrio  will decline significantly in 2023 to approximately $1.0 billion.\nIn 2021, COVID-19-related disruptions resulted  in an estimated negative impact to Pharmaceutical segment sales of approximately $1.3 billion because a\nsubstantial portion of Pharmaceutical segment revenue is comprised of physician-administered products, which were unfavorably affected by social distancing measures\nand fewer well visits. Sales in 2021 benefited from $952 million of Lagevrio  sales.\nIn April 2021, Merck announced it was discontin uing the development of MK-71 10 for the treatm ent of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, which was obtained\nas part of Merck\u2019 s acqui sition of OncoImmune (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statem ents). This decision resulted in charges of $207 million to Cost of sales in\n2021.\nOperating expenses in 2021 reflect a minor positive effect as investments in COVID-19-related research largely offset the favorable impact of lower spending in\nother areas due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn March 2021, Merck announced it had entered into multiple agreements to support efforts to expand manufacturing capacity and supply of SARS-CoV -\n2/COVID-19 medicines and vaccines. The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), a division of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for\nPreparedness and Response within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, provided Merck with $102 million of funding in the first quarter of 2022 to adapt\nand make available a number of existing manufacturing facilities for the production of SARS-Co V-2/COVID-19 vaccines and medicines. The funding was recognized as a\nreduction to Cost of sales over the expected production period, offsetting the depreciation expense related to the amou nts that were capitalized in connection with the\nmodification of the manufacturing facilities. Merck and Johnson & Johnson have commenced an arbitration regarding a dispute concerning two agreements pursuant to\nwhich Merck  was supporting the manufacturing and supply of Johnson & Johnson\u2019 s SARS-CoV -2/COVID-19 vaccine and vaccine drug product. The amounts included in\nthe consolidated financial statements for these agreements were immaterial in 2022. Merck does not believe the outcome of the arbitration will have a material impact on\nthe Company\u2019 s financial statements.\nPricing\nGlobal efforts toward health care cost containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing and market access worldwide.

In several international markets, government-mandated pricing actions have reduced prices of generic and\npatented drugs. In addition, the Company\u2019 s sales performance in 2022 was negatively affected by other cost-reduction measures taken by governments and other third\nparties to lower health care costs. In 2022, the U.S. Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act, which makes significant changes to how drugs are covered and paid for\nunder the Medicare program, including the creation of financial penalties for drugs whose prices rise faster than the rate of inflation, redesign of the Medicare Part D\nprogram to require manu facturers to bear more of the liability for certain drug benefits, and gover nment price-setting for certain Medicare Part D drugs (starting in 2026) and\nMedicare Part B drugs (starting in 2028). In the U.S., the Biden Administration and Congress continue to discuss legislation designed to control health care costs, including\nthe cost of drugs. The Company anticipates all of these actions and additional actions in the future will negatively af fect sales and profits.\nSupply Chain\nAs a result of global macroeconomic conditions , the Company is experiencing some minor disruption and volatility in its global supply chain network.

This program is a continuation of the Company\u2019 s plant rationalization and builds on\nprior restruc turing programs. The actions curren tly contemplated under the Restructuring Progra m are expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2023, with the\ncumulative pretax costs  to be incurred by the Company to implement the program estimated to be approximately $3.7 billion. Merck expects to record charges of\napproximately $400 million in 2023 related to the Restructuring Program. The Company anticip ates the actions under the Restructuring Program will result in cumulative\nannual net cost savings of approximately $900 million by the end of 2023.\nRestructuring costs, primarily representing sepa ration and other related costs associated with these restructuring activities, were $337 million in 2022 and $661\nmillion in 2021. Separation costs incurred were  associated with actual headcount reductions , as well as estimated expenses under existing severance programs for\ninvoluntary headcount reductions that were probable and could be reasonably estimated.

To achieve this objective, the Company will\nhedge a portion of its forecasted foreign currency denominated third-party and intercompany distributor entity sales (forecasted sales) that are expected to occur over its\nplanning cycle, typically no more than two years into the future. The Company will layer in hedg es over time, increasing the portion of forecasted sales hedged as it gets\ncloser to the expected date of the forecasted sales. The portion of forecasted sales hedged is based on assessments of cost-benefit profiles that consider natural offsetting\nexposures, revenue and exchange rate volatilit ies and correlations, and the cost of hedging instruments. The Company manages its anticipated transaction exposure\nprincipally with purchased local currency put options, forward contracts, and purchased collar options.\nThe fair values of these derivative contracts are recorded as either assets (gain positions) or liabilities (loss positions) in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nChanges in the fair value of derivative contracts  are recorded each period in either current earnings or Other Comp rehensive  Income (Loss) (OCI) , depending on whether\nthe derivative is designa ted as part of a hedge transaction and, if so, the type of hedge transaction. For derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges, the unrealized\ngains or losses on these  contracts are recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss (AOCL)  and reclassified into Sales  when the hedged anticipated revenue is\nrecognized. For those derivatives which are not designated as cash flow hedges, but serve as economic hedges of forecasted sales, unrealized gains or losses are\nrecorded in Sales  each period. The cash flows from both designated and non-designated contracts are reported  as operating activities in the Consolidated Statement of\nCash Flows. The Company does not enter into derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.\nBecause Merck principally sells foreign currency in its revenue hedging program, a uniform weak ening of the U.S. dollar would yield the largest overall potential\nloss in the market value of these hedge instruments. The market value of Merck\u2019 s hedges would have declined by an estimated $647 million and $648 million at\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively , from a uniform 10% weakening of the U.S. dollar . The market value was determined using a foreign exchange option pricing\nmodel and holding all factors except exchange rates constant. Although not predictive in nature , the Company believes that a 10% threshold reflects reasonably possible\nnear-term changes in Merck\u2019 s major foreign currency exposures relative to the U.S. dollar .\nThe Company manages operating activities and net asset positions at each local subsidiary in order to mitigate the effects of exchange on monetary assets and\nliabilities. Monetary assets and liabilities denom inated in a currency other than the functional currency of a given subsidiary are remeasured at spot rates in effect on the\nbalance sheet date with the effects of changes in spot rates reported in Other (incom e) expense , net. The Company also uses a balance sheet risk management program to\nmitigate the exposure of such assets and liabilities from the effects of volatility in foreign exchang e.

The cash flows from these contracts are reported as operating activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.\nThe economy of T\u00fcrkiye was determined to be hyperinflationary in 2022. Consequently , in acco rdance with U.S. GAAP , the Company began remeasuring the\nmonetary assets and liabilities of those operations in earnings beginning in the second quarter of 2022. The impact to the Company\u2019 s results is immaterial.\nThe Company also uses  forward exchange contracts to hedge a portion of its net investment in foreign operations against movements in exchange rates. The\nforward contracts are designated as hedges of the net investment in a foreign operation. The unrealized gains or losses on these contracts are recorded in foreign currency\ntranslation adjustment within OCI, and remain in AOCL  until either the sale or complete or substantial ly complete liquidation of the subsidiary . The Company excludes\ncertain portio ns of the change in fair value of its derivative instruments from the assessment of hedge effectiveness (excluded components). Changes in fair value of the\nexcluded components are recognized in OCI. The Company recognizes in earnings the initial value of the excluded components on a straight-line basis over the life of the\nderivative instrument, rather than using the mark-to-market approach. The cash flows from these contracts are reported as investing activities in the Consolidated Statement\nof Cash Flows.\nForeign exchange risk is also managed through the use of foreign currency debt.

Accordingly , foreign currency transaction gains or losses due to spot rate\nfluctuations on the euro-denominated debt instruments are included in foreign currency translation adjustment within OCI.\nInterest Rate Risk Management\nThe Company may use interest rate swap contracts on certain investing and borrowing transactions to manage its net exposure to interest rate changes and to\nreduce its overall cost of borrowing. The Compa ny does not use leveraged swaps and, in general, does not leverage any of its investment activities that would put principal\nat risk. The Company is not currently a party to any interest rate swaps.\nThe Compan y\u2019s investment portfolio includes cash equivalents and short-term investments, the market values of which are not significantly affected by changes\nin interest rates. The market value of the Company\u2019 s medium- to long-term fixed-rate investments is modestly affected by changes in U.S. interest rates. Changes in\nmedium- to long-term U.S. interest rates have  a more significant impact on the market value of the Company\u2019 s fixed-rate borrowings, which generally have longer\nmaturities. A sensitivity analysis to measure potential changes in the market value of Merck\u2019 s investments and debt from a change in interest rates indicated that a one\npercentage point increase in interest rates at December 31, 2022 and 2021 would have positively affected the net aggregate market value of these instruments by $2.0\nbillion and $3.2 billion, respectively . A one perce ntage point decrease at December 31, 2022 and 2021 would have negatively affected the net aggregate market value by\n$2.4 billion and $3.9 billion, respectively .

To be considered a business, the\nassets in a transaction need to include an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs.\nIn a busines s combinati on, the acquisition meth od of accounting requires that the assets acqu ired and liabilities assumed be recorded as of the date of the\nacquisition at their respective fair values with limited exceptions. The fair values of intangible assets are determined utilizing information available near the acquisition date\nbased on expectations and assumptions that are deemed reasonable by management. Given the considerable judgment involved in determining fair values, the Company\ntypically obtains assistance from third-party valuation specialists for significant items. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination that arise from\ncontingencies are generally recognized at fair value. If fair value cannot be determined, the asset or liability is recognized if probable and reasonably estimable; if these\ncriteria are not met, no asset or liability is recognized. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit\nprice) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transact ion between market participants on the measurement date. Accordingly , the\nCompany may be required to value assets at fair value measures that do not reflect the Company\u2019 s intended use of those assets.

Shipping is considered immaterial in the context of the\noverall customer arrangement and damages or loss of goods in transit are rare. Therefore, shipping is not deemed a separately recognized performance obligation.\nThe vast majority of revenues from sales of products are recognized at a point in time when control of the goods is transferred to the customer , which the\nCompany has determined is when title and risks and rewards of ownership transfer to the customer and the Company is entitled to payment. For certain services in the\nAnimal Health segment, revenue is recognized over time, generally ratably over the contract term as services are provided. These service revenues are not material.\nThe nature of the Company\u2019 s business gives rise to several types of variable consideration including discounts and returns, which are estimated at the time of\nsale generally using the expected value method, although the most likely amount method is used for prompt pay discounts.\nIn the U.S., sales discou nts are issued to customers at the point-of-sale, through an intermediary  wholesaler (known as chargebacks), or in the form of rebates.\nAdditionally , sales are generally made with a limited right of return under certain conditions. Revenues are recorded net of provisions for sales discounts and returns, which\nare established at the time of sale. In addition, if collection of accounts receivable is expected to be in excess of one year, sales are recorded net of time value of money\ndiscounts, which have not been material.\nThe U.S. provision for aggregate customer discounts covers chargebacks and rebates. Charg ebacks are discounts that occur when a contracted customer\npurchases through an intermediary wholesaler . The contracted customer generally purchases product from the wholesaler at its contracted price plus a mark-up. The\nwholesaler , in turn, charges the Company back for the difference between the price initially paid by the wholesaler and the contract price paid to the wholesaler by the\ncustomer . The provision for chargebacks is based on expected sell-through levels by the Comp any\u2019s wholesale customers to contracted customers, as well as estimated\nwholesaler inventory levels. Rebates are amounts owed based upon definitive contractual agreements or legal requirements with private sector and public sector (Medicaid\nand Medicare Part D) benefit providers after the final dispensing of the product to a benefit plan participant. The provision for rebates is based on expected patient usage,\nas well as inventory levels in the distribution channel to determine the contractual obligation to the benefit providers. The Company uses historical customer segment\nutilization mix, sales forecasts, changes to product mix and price, inventory levels in the distribution channel, government pricing calculations and prior payment history in\norder to estimate the expected provision.

In certain European countries, legislatively mandated rebates are\ncalculated based on an estimate of the government\u2019 s total unbudgeted spending and the Comp any\u2019s specific payback obligation. Rebates may also be required based on\nspecific product sales thresholds. The Company applies an estimated factor against its actual invoiced sales to represent the expected level of future discount or rebate\nobligations associated with the sale.\nThe Company maintains a returns policy that allows its U.S. pharmaceutical customers to return product within a specified period prior to and subsequent to the\nexpiration date (generall y, three to six months before and 12 months after product expiration). The estimate of the provision for returns is based upon historical experience\nwith actual returns. Additionally , the Company considers factors such as levels of inventory in the distribution channel, product dating and expiration period, whether\nproducts have been discontinued, entrance in the market of generic or other competition, change s in formularies or launch of over-the-counter products, among others. The\nproduct returns provision  for U.S. pharmaceutical sales as a percentage of U.S. net pharmaceuti cal sales was 1.1% in 2022, 0.9% in 2021 and 0.5% in 2020.

Outside of the U.S., payment\nterms are typically 30 days to 90 days, although certain markets have longer payment terms.\nThrough its distribution programs with U.S. wholesalers, the Company encourages wholesalers to align purchases with underlying demand and maintain\ninventories below specif ied levels. The terms of the programs allow the wholesalers to earn fees upon providing visibility into their inventory levels, as well as by achieving\ncertain perfo rmance parameters such as invent ory management, customer service levels, reducing shortage claims and reducing product returns.

These accruals are\nadjusted periodically as assessments change or additional information becomes available. For product liability claims, a portion of the overall accrual is actuarially\ndetermined and considers such factors as past experience, number of claims reported and estimates of claims incurred but not yet reported. Individually significant\ncontingent losses are accrued when probable and reasonably estimable.\nLegal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency are accrued when probable and reasonably estimable. Some of the\nsignificant factors considered in the review of these legal defense reserves are as follows: the actual costs incurred by the Company; the development of the Company\u2019 s\nlegal defens e strategy and structure in light of the scope of its litigation; the number of cases being brought against the Company; the costs and outcomes of completed\ntrials and the most current information regarding anticipated timing, progression, and related costs of pre-trial activities and trials in the associated litigation. The amount of\nlegal defense reserves as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 of approximately $230 million represents the Company\u2019 s best estimate of the minimum amount of defense costs\nto be incurre d in connection with its outstanding litigation; however , events such as additional trials and other events that could arise in the course of its litigation could affect\nthe ultimate amount of legal defense costs to be incurred by the Company . The Company will continue to monitor its legal defense costs and review the adequacy of the\nassociated reserves and may determine to increase the reserves at any time in the future if, based upon the factors set forth, it believes it would be appropriate to do so.\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are parties to a number of proceedings brought under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and\nLiability Act, commonly known as Superfund, and other federal and state equivalents. When a legitimate claim for contribution is asserted, a liability is initially accrued based\nupon the estimated transaction costs to manage the site. Accruals are adjusted as site investigations, feasibility studies and related cost assessments of remedial\ntechniques are complet ed, and as the extent to which other potentially responsible parties who may be jointly and severally liable can be expected to contribute is\ndetermined.\nThe Compan y is also remediating environmenta l contamination resulting from past industrial activity at certain of its sites and takes an active role in identifying\nand accruing  for these costs. In the past, Merck performed a worldwide survey to assess all sites for potential contamination resulting from past industrial activities. Where\nassessment indicated that physical investigation was warranted, such investigation was performed, providing a better evaluation of the need for remedial action. Where\nsuch need was identified, remedial action was then initiated. As definitive information became available during the course of investigations and/or remedial efforts at each\nsite, estimates were refined and accruals were established or adjusted accordingly . These estimates and related accruals continue to be refined annually .\nThe Compan y believes that there are no compliance issues associated with applicable environmental laws and regulations that would have a material adverse\neffect on the Company .

For segment reporting, share-based compensation costs are unallocated expenses.\nPensions and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans\nNet periodic  benefit cost for pension plans totaled $554 million in 2022, $748 million in 2021 and $450 million in 2020. Net periodic benefit credit for other\npostretirement benefit plans was $93 million in 2022, $83 million in 2021 and $59 million in 2020. Pension and other postretirement benefit plan information for financial\nreporting purposes is calculated using actuarial assumptions including a discount rate for plan benefit obligations and an expected rate of return on plan assets. The\nchanges in net periodic benefit cost year over year for pension plans are primarily attributable to changes in the discount rates. Additionally , net periodic benefit costs in\n2022 and 2021 reflect higher settlement charges incurred by certain plans compared with 2020.\nThe Company reassesses its benefit plan assu mptions on a regular basis. For both the pension and other postretirement benefit plans, the discount rate is\nevaluated on measurem ent dates and modified to reflect the prevailing market rate of a portfolio  of high-quality fixed-income debt instruments that would provide the future\ncash flows needed to pay the benefits included in the benefit obligation as they come due. The discount rates for the Company\u2019 s U.S. pension and other postretirement\nbenefit plans ranged from 5.50% to 5.90% at December 31, 2022, compared with a range of 2.60% to 3.10% at December 31, 2021.\nThe expected rate of return for both the pension and other postretirement benefit plans represe nts the average rate of return to be earned on plan assets over\nthe period the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid. In developing the expec ted rate of return, the Company considers long-term compound annualized\nreturns of historical market data, current market conditions and actual returns on the Compan y\u2019s plan assets. Using this reference information, the Company develops\nforward-looking return expectations for each asset category and a weighted-average expected long-term rate of return for a target portfolio allocated across these\ninvestment categories. The expected portfolio performance reflects the contribution of active management as appropriate. For 2023, the expected rate of return for the\nCompany\u2019 s U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans will be 7.00% compared to 6.70% in 2022.\nThe Compan y has established investment guide lines for its U.S. pension and other postretireme nt plans to create an asset allocation that is expected to deliver\na rate of return sufficient to meet the long-term obligation of each plan, given an acceptable level of risk. The target investment portfolio of the Company\u2019 s U.S. pension and\nother postre tirement benefit plans is allocated 25% to 40% in U.S. equities, 10% to 20% in international equities, 35% to 45% in fixed-income investments, and up to 8% in\ncash and other investments. The portfolio\u2019 s equity weighting is consistent with the long-term nature of the plans\u2019  benefit obligations.

In connection with these actions, management also assesses the\nrecoverability of long-lived assets employed in the business. In certain instances, asset lives have been shortened based on changes in the expected useful lives of the\naffected assets. Severan ce and other related costs are reflected within Restructuring costs . Asset-relat ed charges are reflected within Cost of sales , Selling, gene ral and\nadministrative  expenses and Research and development  expenses depending upon the nature of the asset.\nImpairments of Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company assesses changes in economic, regulatory and legal conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows in evaluating the\nvalue of the Company\u2019 s property , plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets.\nThe Company periodically evaluates whether current facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying values of its long-lived assets to be held and used may not\nbe recoverable. If such circumstances are determined to exist, an estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows of these assets, or appropriate asset groupings, is\ncompared to the carrying  value to determine whether an impairment exists. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between\nthe asset\u2019s fair value and its carrying value. If quoted market prices are not available, the Compa ny will estimate fair value using a discounted value of estimated future cash\nflows approach.\nGoodwill represents the excess of the considera tion transferred over the fair value of net assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill is assigned to reporting units\nand evaluated for impair ment on at least an annual basis, or more frequently if impairment indicators exist, by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is\nmore likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Some of the factors considered in the assessment include general macroeconomic\nconditions, conditions specific to the industry and market, cost factors which could have a significant effect on earnings or cash flows, the overall financial performance of\nthe reporting unit, and whether there have been sustained declines in the Company\u2019 s share price. If the Company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of a\nreporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative fair value test is performed. If the carrying value of a reporting unit is greater than its fair value, a goodwill\nimpairment charge will be recorded for the dif ference (up to the carrying value of goodwill).\nOther acquir ed intangible assets (excluding IPR&D) are initially recorded at fair value, assigned an estimated useful life, and amortized primarily on a straight-\nline basis over their estimated useful lives. When events or circumstances warrant a review , the Company will assess recoverability from future operations using pretax\nundiscounted cash flows derived from the lowes t appropriate asset groupings. Impairments are recognized in operating results to the extent that the carrying value of the\nintangible asset exceeds its fair value, which is determined based on the net present value of estimated future cash flows.\nIPR&D that the Company acquires in conjunctio n with the acquisition of a business represents the fair value assigned to incomplete research projects which, at\nthe time of acquisition, have not reached techno logical feasibility . The amounts are capitalized and accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets, subject to impairment\ntesting until completion or abandonment of the projects. The Company evaluates IPR&D for impairment at least annually , or more frequently if impairment indicators exist\n(such as unfavorable clinical trial data, changes in the commercial landscape or delays in the clinical development program and related regulatory filing and approval\ntimelines), by performin g a quantitative test that compares the fair value of the IPR&D intan gible asset with its carrying value.

per share amounts)\n1.   Nature of Operations\nMerck & Co., Inc. (Merck or the Company) is a global health care company that delivers innovative health solutions through its prescription medicines, including\nbiologic therapies, vaccines and animal health products. The Company\u2019 s operations are principally managed on a product basis and include two operating segments,\nPharmaceutical and Animal Health, both of which are reportable segments.\nThe Pharma ceutical segment includes human health pharmaceutical and vaccine products. Human health pharmaceutical products consist of therapeutic and\npreventive agents, generally sold by prescription, for the treatment of human disorders. The Com pany sells these human health pharmaceutical products primarily to drug\nwholesalers and retailers, hospitals, government  agencies and managed health care providers such as health maintenance organizations, pharmacy benefit managers and\nother institutions. Human health vaccine product s consist of preventive pediatric, adolescent and adult vaccines. The Company sells these human health vaccines primarily\nto physicians, wholesalers, physician distributors and government entities.\nThe Animal Health segment discovers, develops , manufactures and markets a wide range of veterinary pharmaceutical and vaccine products, as well as health\nmanagement solutions and services, for the prevention, treatment and control of disease in all major livestock and companion animal species. The Company also offers an\nextensive suite of digita lly connected identification, traceability and monitoring products. The Company sells its products to veterinarians, distributors, animal producers,\nfarmers and pet owners.\nSpin-Off of Organon & Co.\nOn June 2, 2021, Merck  completed the spin-of f of products from its women\u2019 s health, biosimilars and established brands businesses into a new, independent,\npublicly traded company named Organon & Co. (Organon) through a distribution of Organon\u2019 s publicly traded stock to Company shareholders. The distribution is expected\nto qualify and has been treated as tax-free to the Company and its shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The established brands included in the transaction\nconsisted of dermatology , non-opioid pain mana gement, respiratory , select cardiovascular products, as well as the rest of Merck\u2019 s diversified brands franchise. Merck\u2019 s\nexisting research pipelin e programs continue to be owned and developed within Merck as planned. The historical results of the businesses that were contributed to Organon\nin the spin-of f have been reflected as discontinued operations in the Company\u2019 s consolidated financial statements through the date of the spin-of f (see Note 3).\n2.    Summary of Accounting Policies\nPrinciples of Consolidat ion \u2014 The consolid ated financ ial statements include the accounts of the Company and all of its subsidiaries in which a controlling\ninterest is maintained. Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated. Controlling interest is determined by majority ownership interest and the absence of\nsubstantive third-party participating rights or, in the case of variable interest entities, by majority exposure to expected losses, residual returns or both. For those\nconsolidated subsidiarie s where Merck ownership is less than 100%, the outside shareholders \u2019 interests are shown as Noncontrolling interests  in equity . Investments in\naffiliates over which the Company has significant influence but not a controlling interest, such as interests in entities owned equally by the Company and a third party that\nare under shared control, are carried on the equity basis.\nAcquisitions \u2014 In a business combinatio n, the acquisition method of accounting requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded as of the\ndate of the acquisition at their respective fair values with limited exceptions.

If fair value cannot be determined, the asset or liability is recognized if probable and reasonably estimable; if these criteria are not\nmet, no asset or liability is recognized. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the\nprincipal or most advant ageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Accordingly , the Company\nmay be required to value assets at fair value measures that do not reflect the Company\u2019 s inten ded use of those assets. Any excess of the purchase price (consideration\ntransferred) over the estimated fair values of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Transa ction costs and costs to restructure the acquired company are expensed as\nincurred. The operating results of the acquired business are reflected in the Company\u2019 s consolidated financial statements after the date of the acquisition.

The U.S. dollar effects that arise from\ntranslating the net assets of these subsidiaries at changing rates are recorded in Other Comprehensive Income (OCI)  and remain in Accumulated other comprehensive loss\n(AOCL ) until either the sale or complete or substantially complete liquidation of the subsidiary . For those subsidiaries that operate in highly inflationary economies and for\nthose subsid iaries wher e the U.S. dollar has been determined to be the functional currency , non-monetary foreign currency assets and liabilities are translated using\nhistorical rates, while monetary assets and liabilities are translated at current rates, with the U.S. dollar ef fects of rate changes included in Other (income) expense, net .\nCash Equivalents \u2014  Cash equivalents are comprised of certain highly liquid investments with original maturities of less than three months.\nInventories \u2014 Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The cost of a substantial majority of U.S. human health inventories is\ndetermined using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method for both financial reporting and tax purpose s. The cost of all other inventories is determined using the first-in, first-out\n(FIFO) meth od. Inventor ies consist of currently marketed products, as well as certain inventorie s produced in preparation for product launches that are considered by the\nCompany to be probable of obtaining regulatory approval. In evaluating the recoverability of inventories produced in preparation for product launches, the Company\nconsiders the likelihood that revenue will be obtained from the future sale of the related inventory together with the status of the product within the regulatory approval\nprocess.\nInvestments \u2014 Investments in marketa ble debt securities classified as available-for-sale are reported at fair value. Fair values of the Company\u2019 s investments in\nmarketable debt securities are determined using quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or quoted prices for similar assets or other inputs that are\nobservable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Changes in fair value that are not impairment related\nare reported  net of taxes  in OCI. The Company considers available evidence in evaluating potential impairments of its investme nts in marketable debt securities, including\nthe extent to which fair value is less than cost, whether an allowance for credit loss is required, as well as adverse factors that could affect the value of the securities. An\nimpairment has occurred  if the Company does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the marketable debt security . If the Company does not intend to sell\nthe impaired debt security , and it is not more likely than not it will be required to sell the debt security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis, the amount of the\nimpairment recognized in earnings, recorded in Other (income) expense, net is limited to the portion attributed to credit loss.

Realized gains and losses for equity securities are included in Other (income) expense, net .\nRevenue Recognition \u2014 Recognition of revenue requires evidence of a contract, probable collection of sales proceeds and completion of substantially all\nperformance obligations. Merck acts as the principal in substantially all of its customer arrangem ents and therefore records revenue on a gross basis. The majority of the\nCompany\u2019 s contracts related to the Pharmaceutical and Animal Health segments have a single performance obligation - the promise to transfer goods. Shipping is\nconsidered immaterial in the context of the overall customer arrangement and damages or loss of goods in transit are rare. Therefore, shipping is not deemed a separately\nrecognized performance obligation.\nThe vast majority of revenues from sales of products are recognized at a point in time when control of the goods is transferred to the customer , which the\nCompany has determine d is when title and risks and rewards of ownership transfer to the customer and the Company is entitled to payment. The Company recognizes\nrevenue from the sales of vaccines to the Federal government for placement into vaccine stockpiles in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)\nInterpretation , Commission Guidance Regarding Accounting for Sales of V accines\n76", "start_char_idx": 4089, "end_char_idx": 6026, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ce2bf2f3-28ee-429b-8532-f0021dbb96f8": {"__data__": {"id_": "ce2bf2f3-28ee-429b-8532-f0021dbb96f8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "79", "file_name": "merck_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "data\\merck_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf_part_78", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "79", "file_name": "merck_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "8271b7273d0a94d26161935d0af7ffd6569fa5d4be269a578664d2951499f9dd"}, "3": {"node_id": "04f77c7f-199e-4e6e-942a-f8534519b4f5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "79", "file_name": "merck_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "00b97f395fd1be6b02430f3b02cbaa665cf117ac48d3c7e8f86092892e93dca7"}}, "hash": "885a196338e56867fd582421eb80ed027d9d9f82f77785565b635fdaed38cd1b", "text": "Table of Contents\nand BioTerror Countermeasures to the Federal Government for Placement into the Pediatric Vaccine Stockpile or the Strategic National Stockpile . This interpretation allow s\ncompanies to recognize  revenue for sales of vaccines into U.S. government stockpiles even though these sales might not meet the criteria for revenue recognition under\nother accou nting guidan ce. Some customers have bill-and-hold arrangements with the Comp any. Revenue for bill-and-hold arrangements is recognized when control\ntransfers to the customer even though the customer does not yet have physical possession of the goods. Control transfers when the bill-and-hold arrangement has been\nrequested by the customer , the product is identified as belonging to the customer and is ready for physical transfer , the product cannot be directed for use by anyone but the\ncustomer and, in certain circumstances, the customer has inspected and accepted the product at the Company\u2019 s facility . For certain services in the Animal Health segment,\nrevenue is recognized over time, generally ratably over the contract term as services are provided. These service revenues are not material.\nThe nature of the Company\u2019 s business gives rise to several types of variable consideration including discounts and returns, which are estimated at the time of\nsale generally using the expected value method, although the most likely amount method is used for prompt pay discounts.\nIn the U.S., sales discou nts are issued to customers at the point-of-sale, through an intermediary  wholesaler (known as chargebacks), or in the form of rebates.\nAdditionally , sales are generally made with a limited right of return under certain conditions. Revenues are recorded net of provisions for sales discounts and returns, which\nare established at the time of sale. In addition, if collection of accounts receivable is expected to be in excess of one year, sales are recorded net of time value of money\ndiscounts, which have not been material.\nThe U.S. provision for aggregate customer discounts covering chargebacks and rebates was $12.3 billion in 2022, $12.3 billion in 2021 and $11.4 billion in 2020.\nChargebacks are discounts that occur when a contracted customer purchases through an intermediary wholesaler . The contracted customer generally purchases product\nfrom the wholesaler at its contracted price plus a mark-up. The wholesaler , in turn, charges the Company back for the difference between the price initially paid by the\nwholesaler and the contract price paid to the wholesaler by the customer . The provision for chargebacks is based on expected sell-through levels by the Company\u2019 s\nwholesale customers to contracted customers, as well as estimated wholesaler inventory levels. Rebates are amounts owed based upon definitive contractual agreements\nor legal requirements with private sector and public sector (Medicaid and Medicare Part D) benefit providers after the final dispensing of the product to a benefit plan\nparticipant. The provision  for rebates is based on expected patient usage, as well as inventory levels in the distribution channel to determine the contractual obligation to the\nbenefit providers. The Company uses historical customer segment utilization mix, sales foreca sts, changes to product mix and price, inventory levels in the distribution\nchannel, government pricing calculations and prior payment history in order to estimate the expected provision. Amounts accrued for aggregate customer discounts are\nevaluated on a quarterly basis through comparison of information provided by the wholesalers, health maintenance organizations, pharmacy benefit managers, federal and\nstate agenci es, and other customers to the amounts accrued. The accrued balances relative to the provisions for chargebacks and rebates included in Accounts receivable\nand Accrued and other curre nt liabilities  were $178 million and $2.7 billion, respectively , at December 31, 2022 and were $207 million  and $2.6 billion, respectively , at\nDecember 31, 2021.\nOutside of the U.S., variable consideration in the form of discounts and rebates are a", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4132, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "04f77c7f-199e-4e6e-942a-f8534519b4f5": {"__data__": {"id_": "04f77c7f-199e-4e6e-942a-f8534519b4f5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "79", "file_name": "merck_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "data\\merck_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf_part_78", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "79", "file_name": "merck_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "8271b7273d0a94d26161935d0af7ffd6569fa5d4be269a578664d2951499f9dd"}, "2": {"node_id": "ce2bf2f3-28ee-429b-8532-f0021dbb96f8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "79", "file_name": "merck_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "885a196338e56867fd582421eb80ed027d9d9f82f77785565b635fdaed38cd1b"}}, "hash": "00b97f395fd1be6b02430f3b02cbaa665cf117ac48d3c7e8f86092892e93dca7", "text": "the U.S., variable consideration in the form of discounts and rebates are a combination of commercially-driven discounts in highly competitive product\nclasses, discounts required to gain or maintain reimbursement, or legislatively mandated rebates.

Rebates may also be required based on\nspecific product sales thresholds. The Company applies an estimated factor against its actual invoiced sales to represent the expected level of future discount or rebate\nobligations associated with the sale.\nThe Company maintains a returns policy that allows its U.S. pharmaceutical customers to return product within a specified period prior to and subsequent to the\nexpiration date (generall y, three  to six month s before and 12 months after product expiration). The estimate of the provision for returns is based upon historical experience\nwith actual returns. Additionally , the Company considers factors such as levels of inventory in the distribution channel, product dating and expiration period, whether\nproducts have been discontinued, entrance in the market of generic or other competition, chan ges in formularies or launch of over-the-counter products, among others.\nOutside of the U.S., returns are only allowed in certain countries on a limited basis.\nMerck\u2019 s payment terms for U.S. pharmaceutical customers are typically 36 days from receipt of invoice and for U.S. animal health customers are typically 30\ndays from receipt of invoice; however , certain products, including Keytruda , have longer payment terms, some of which are up to 90 days.

Goodwill is assigned to\nreporting units and evaluated for impairment on at least an annual basis, or more frequently if impairment indicators exist, by first assessing qualitative factors to determine\nwhether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the Company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value\nof a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative fair value test is performed. If the carrying value of a reporting unit is greater than its fair value, a goodwill\nimpairment charge will be recorded for the dif ference (up to the carrying value of goodwill).\nAcquired Intangibles \u2014 Intangibles acquired in a business combination include products and product rights, trade names and patents, licenses and other , which\nare initially recorded at fair value, assigned an estimated useful life, and amortized primarily on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives ranging from 2 to\n24 years. The Company  periodically evaluates whether current facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying values of its acquired intangibles may not be recoverable.

Subsequent to the acquisition date, at each reporting period until the contingency is resolved, the contingent consideration liability\nis remeasure d at current fair value with changes (either expense or income) recorded in earning s. Significant events that increase or decrease the probability of achieving\ndevelopment and regulatory milestones or that increase or decrease projected cash flows will result in corresponding increases or decreases in the fair values of the related\ncontingent consideration obligations.\nResearch and Development \u2014 Research and development is expensed as incurred.

Research and development expenses also include upfront and\nmilestone payments related to asset acquisitions and licensing transactions involving clinical development programs that have not yet received regulatory approval.\nCollaborative Arrangeme nts \u2014 Merck has entered into collaborative arrangements that provide the Company with varying rights  to develop, produce and market\nproducts together with its collaborative partners. When Merck is the principal on sales transactions with third parties, the Company recognizes sales, cost of sales and\nselling, general and administrative expenses on a gross basis. Profit sharing amounts it pays to its collaborative partners are recorded within Cost of sales . When the\ncollaborative partner is the principal on sales transactions with third parties, the Company record s profit sharing amounts received from its collaborative partners as alliance\nrevenue (within Sales ). Alliance revenue is recorded net of cost of sales and includes an adjustment to share commer cialization costs between the partners in accordance\nwith the collaboration agreement. The adjustment is determined by comparing the commercialization costs Merck has incurred directly and reported within Selling, gene ral\nand adminis trative  expenses with the costs the collaborative partner has incurred. Research and development costs Merck incurs related to collaborations are recorded\nwithin Research and development  expenses. Cost reimbu rsements to the collabo rative partner or payments received from the collaborative partner to share these costs\npursuant to the terms of the collaboration agreements are recorded as increases or decreases to Research and development  expenses.\nIn addition, the terms of the collaboration agreements may require the Company to make payments based upon the achievement of certain developmental,\nregulatory approval or commercial milestones. Upfront and milestone payments payable by Merck to collaborative partners prior to regulatory approval are expensed as\nincurred and included in Research and developm ent expenses. Payments due to collaborative partn ers upon or subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and\namortized to Cost of sales  over the estimated useful life of the corresponding intangible asset provided that future cash flows support the amounts capitalized. Sales-based\nmilestones payable by Merck to collaborative partners are accrued and capitalized, subject to cumulative amortization catch-up, when determined to be probable of being\nachieved by the Compan y. The amortization catch-up is calculated either from the time of the first regulatory approval for indications that were unapproved at the time the\ncollaboration was formed, or from time of the formation of the collaboration for approved products. The related intangible asset that is recognized is amortized to Cost of\nsales  over its remaining useful life, subject to impairment testing.\nShare-Based Compensation \u2014 The Compan y expenses all share-based payme nts to employees over the requisite service period based on the grant-date fair\nvalue of the awards.\nRestructuring Costs \u2014 The Company records liabilities for costs associated with exit or disposal activities in the period in which the liability is incurred. In\naccordance with existing benefit arrangements , future employee termination costs to be incurred in conjunction with involuntary separations are accrued when such\nseparations are probable and estimable. When accruing these costs, the Company will recognize the amount within a range of costs that is the best estimate within the\nrange.

Estimates are used when accounting for amounts recorded in\nconnection with acquisitions, including initial fair value determinations of assets and liabilities in a business combination (primarily IPR&D, other intangible assets and\ncontingent consideration), as well as subsequent fair value measurements.

The guidance requires annual disclosures of such transactions to include the nature of the transactions and the significant terms\nand conditio ns, the accounting treatment and the impact to a company\u2019 s financial statements. The Company adopted the new guidance on January 1, 2022 on a\nprospective basis. There was no material impact to the Company\u2019 s consolidated financial statements upon adoption.\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued optional guidance to ease the potential burden in accounting for (or recognizing the effects of) reference rate reform on financial\nreporting and subsequently issued clarifying amendments. The guidance provides optional expedients and exceptions for accounting for contracts, hedging relationships,\nand other transactions that reference the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform.\nThe Company adopted the optional guidance on July 1, 2022 on a prospective basis.

Spin-Off of Organon & Co.\nOn June 2, 2021, Merck  completed the spin-of f of Organon through a distribution of Organon\u2019 s publicly traded stock to Company shareholders. In connection\nwith the spin-of f, each Merck shareholder received one-tenth of a share of Organon\u2019 s common stock for each share of Merck common stock held by such shareholder . The\ndistribution is expected to qualify and has been treated as tax free to Merck and its shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Indebtedness of $9.5 billion principal\namount, consisting of term loans and senior notes, was issued in 2021 in connection with the spin-of f and assumed by Organon. Merck is no longer the obligor of any\nOrganon debt or financing arrangements. Cash proceeds of $9.0 billion were distributed by Organon to Merck in connection with the spin-of f.\nAlso in connection with the spin-of f, Merck and Organon entered into a separation and distributio n agreement and also entered into various other agreements to\neffect the spin-of f and provide a framework for the relationship between Merck and Organon after the spin-of f, including a transition services agreement (TSA),\nmanufacturing and supply agreements (MSAs), trademark license agreements, intellectual property license agreements, an employee matters agreement, a tax matters\nagreement and certain other commercial agree ments. Under the TSA, Merck is providing Organon various services and, similarly , Organon is providing Merck various\nservices. The provision of services under the TSA generally will terminate within 25 months following the spin-of f; however , the provision of certain services has been\nextended to 35 months. Merck and Organon also entered into a series of interim operating agreements pursuant to which in various jurisdictions where Merck held licenses,\npermits and other rights in connection with marketing, import and/or distribution of Organon products prior to the separation, Merck is continuing to market, import and\ndistribute such products until such time as the relevant licenses and permits are transferred to Organon. Under such interim operating agreements and in accordance with\nthe separation and distri bution agreement, Merck is continuing operations in the affected markets on behalf of Organon, with Organon receiving all of the economic benefits\nand burdens of such activities. Additionally , Merck and Organon entered into a number of MSAs pursuant to which Merck is (a) manufacturing and supplying certain active\npharmaceutical ingredients for Organon, (b) manufacturing and supplying certain formulated pharmaceutical products for Organon, and (c) packaging and labeling certain\nfinished pharmaceutical products for Organon. Similarly , Organon and Merck entered into a number of MSAs pursuant to which Organon is (a) manufacturing and supplying\ncertain formulated pharmaceutical products for Merck, and (b) packaging and labeling certain finished pharmaceutical products for Merck. The terms of the MSAs range in\ninitial duration from four years to ten years.\nThe amount s included in the consolidated statement of income for the above MSAs includ e sales of $383 million and $219 million in 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively , and related cost of sales of $404 million and $195 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively .

Acquisitions, Research Collaborations and Licensing Agreements\nThe Company continues to pursue acquisition s and the establishment of external alliances such as research collaborations and licensing agreements to\ncomplement its internal research capabilities. These arrangements often include upfront payments, as well as expense reimbursements or payments to the third party , and\nmilestone, royalty or profit share arrangements, contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development. The Company\nalso reviews its marketed products and pipeline to examine candidates which may provide more value through out-licensing and, as part of its portfolio assessment\nprocess, may also divest certain assets.

(Kelun-Biotech) closed a license and collaboration agreement expanding their\nrelationship in which Merck gained exclusive rights for the research, development, manufacture  and commercialization of up to seven investigational preclinical antibody\ndrug conjug ates (ADCs) for the treatment of cancer. Kelun-Biotech retained the right to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize certain licensed and option\nADCs for Chinese mainl and, Hong Kong and Macau.

In connection with the closing of the acquisition, Merck invested $50 million for a 20%\nownership interest in the new entity , which was valued at $33 million resulting in a $17 million premium. Merck also recognized other net liabilities of $22 million. The\nCompany recorded Research and development  expenses of $462 million in 2020 related to this transaction. In 2021, Merck received feedback from the FDA that additional\ndata would be needed to support a potential Emergency Use Authorization application and therefore the Company did not expect MK-71 10 would become available until the\nfirst half of 2022. Given this timeline and the technical, clinical and regulatory uncertainties, the availability of a number of medicines for patients hospitalized with COVID-\n19, and the need to concentrate Merck\u2019 s resources on accelerating the development and manufacture of the most viable therapeutics and vaccines, Merck decided to\ndiscontinue developmen t of MK-71 10 for the treatment of COVID-19.

Financial Instruments\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nThe Company manages the impact of foreign exchange rate movements and interest rate movements on its earnings, cash flows and fair values of assets and\nliabilities through operational means and through the use of various financial instruments, including derivative instruments.\nA significant  portion of the Company\u2019 s revenues and earnings in foreign affiliates is exposed  to changes in foreign exchange rates. The objectives of and\naccounting related to the Company\u2019 s foreign currency risk management program, as well as its interest rate risk management activities are discussed below .\nForeign Currency Risk Management\nThe Compa ny has established revenue hedging , balance sheet risk management and net investment hedging programs to protect against volatility of future\nforeign currency cash flows and changes in fair value caused by changes in foreign exchange rates.\nThe objectiv e of the revenue hedging program is to reduce the variability caused by changes in foreign exchange rates that would affect the U.S. dollar value of\nfuture cash flows derive d from foreign currency denominated sales, primarily the euro, Japanes e yen and Chinese renminbi. To achieve this objective, the Company will\nhedge a portion of its forecasted foreign currency denominated third-party and intercompany distributor entity sales (forecasted sales) that are expected to occur over its\nplanning cycle, typically no more than two years into the future. The Company will layer in hedg es over time, increasing the portion of forecasted sales hedged as it gets\ncloser to the expected date of the forecasted sales. The portion of forecasted sales hedged is based on assessments of cost-benefit profiles that consider natural offsetting\nexposures, revenue and exchange rate volatilit ies and correlations, and the cost of hedging instruments. The Company manages its anticipated transaction exposure\nprincipally with purchased local currency put options, forward contracts, and purchased collar options.\nThe fair values of these derivative contracts are recorded as either assets (gain positions) or liabilities (loss positions) in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nChanges in the fair value of derivative contracts are recorded each period in either current earnings or OCI depending on whether the derivative is designated as part of a\nhedge transa ction and, if so, the type of hedge transaction. For derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges, the unrealized gains or losses on these contracts are\nrecorded in AOCL  and reclass ified into Sales  when  the hedged anticipated revenue is recognized. For those derivatives which are not design ated as cash flow hedges, but\nserve as economic hedges of forecasted sales,  unrealized gains or losses are recorded in Sales  each period .

The forward contracts are not designated as hedges\nand are marked to market through Other (income) expense, net. Accordingly , fair value changes in the forward contracts help mitigate the changes in the value of the\nremeasured assets and liabilities attributable to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, except to the extent of the spot-forward differences. These differences are not\nsignificant due to the short-term nature of the contracts, which typically have average maturities  at inception of less than six months. The cash flows from these contracts\nare reported as operating activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.\nThe Company also uses  forward exchange contracts to hedge a portion of its net investment in foreign operations against movements in exchange rates. The\nforward contracts are designated as hedges of the net investment in a foreign operation. The unrealized gains or losses on these contracts are recorded in foreign currency\ntranslation adjustment within OCI, and remain in AOCL  until either the sale or complete or substantial ly complete liquidation of the subsidiary . The Company excludes\ncertain portio ns of the change in fair value of its derivative instruments from the assessment of hedge effectiveness (excluded components). Changes in fair value of the\nexcluded components are recognized in OCI. The Company recognizes in earnings the initial value of the excluded components on a straight-line basis over the life of the\nderivative instrument, rather than using the mark-to-market approach. The cash flows from these contracts are reported as investing activities in the Consolidated Statement\nof Cash Flows.\nForeign exchange risk is also managed through the use of foreign currency debt. The Company\u2019 s senior unsecured euro-denominated notes have been\ndesignated as, and are effective as, economic hedges of the net investment in a foreign operatio n. Accordingly , foreign currency transaction gains or losses due to spot rate\nfluctuations on the euro-denominated debt instruments are included in foreign currency translation adjustment within OCI.\nThe ef fects of the Company\u2019 s net investment hedges on OCI and the Consolidated Statement of Income are shown below:\nAmount of Pretax (Gain) Loss Recognized in Other\nComprehensive IncomeAmount of Pretax (Gain) Loss Recognized in Other (income)\nexpense, net for Amounts Excluded from Effectiveness Testing\nYears Ended December 31 2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 2020\nNet Investment Hedging Relationships\nForeign exchange contracts $ (48)$ (49)$ 26 $ (1)$ (13)$ (19)\nEuro-denominated notes (162) (296) 385 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \nNo amounts were reclassified from AOCL into income related to the sale of a subsidiary.\nInterest Rate Risk Management\nThe Company may use interest rate swap contracts on certain investing and borrowing transactions to manage its net exposure to interest rate changes and to\nreduce its overall cost of borrowing. The Compa ny does not use leveraged swaps and, in general, does not leverage any of its investment activities that would put principal\nat risk.\nIn 2022, nine interes t rate swap contracts with a total notional amount of $2.25 billion matured.

Fair value was estimated using recent observable market\nprices and would be considered Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy .\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\nOn an ongoing basis, the Company monitors concentrations of credit risk associated with corporate and government issuers of securities and financial\ninstitutions with which it conducts business. Credit exposure limits are established to limit a concentration with any single issuer or institution. Cash and investments are\nplaced in instruments that meet high credit quality standards, as specified in the Company\u2019 s investment policy guidelines.\nThe majority of the Company\u2019 s accounts receivable arise from product sales in the U.S., Europe and China and are primarily due from drug wholesalers and\nretailers, hospitals and government agencies. The Company monitors the financial performance and creditworthiness of its customers so that it can properly assess and\nrespond to changes in their credit profile. The Company also continues to monitor global econom ic conditions, including the volatility associated with international sovereign\neconomies, and associated impacts on the financial markets and its business. \nThe Company\u2019 s customers with the largest accounts receivable balances are: McKesson Corporation, AmerisourceBergen Corporation and Cardinal Health,\nInc., which represented approximately 21%, 20% and 13%, respectively , of total accounts receivable at December 31, 2022. The Company monitors the creditworthiness of\nits customer s to which it grants credit terms in the normal course of business. Bad debts have been minimal. The Company does not normally require collateral or other\nsecurity to support credit sales.\nThe Company has accounts receivable factoring agreements with financial institutions in certain countries to sell accounts receivable. The Company factored\n$2.5 billion and $2.8 billion of accounts receivable as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively , under these factoring arrangements, which reduced outstanding\naccounts receivable. The cash received from the financial institutions is reported within operating  activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. In certain of these\nfactoring arrangements,  for ease of administration, the Company will collect customer payments related to the factored receivables, which it then remits to the financial\ninstitutions. At Decembe r 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had collected $67 million and $62 million, respectively , on behalf of the financial institutions, which is reflected\nas restricted  cash in Other curren t assets  and the related obligation to remit the cash within Accrued and other current liabilities . The Company remitted  the cash to the\nfinancial institutions in January 2023 and 2022, respectively . The net cash flows related to these collections are reported as financing activities in the Consolidated\nStatement of Cash Flows. The cost of factoring such accounts receivable was de minimis .\nDerivative financial instru ments are executed under International Swaps and Derivatives Associa tion master agreements. The master agreements with several of\nthe Company\u2019 s financial institution counterparties  also include credit support annexes. These annexes contain provisions that require collateral to be exchanged depending\non the value of the derivative assets and liabilities, the Company\u2019 s credit rating, and the credi t rating of the counterparty .

In December 2020, the Company temporarily suspended sales of\nZerbaxa , and subseq uently issued a product recall, following the identification of product sterility issues. The recall constituted a triggering event requiring the evaluation of\nthe Zerbaxa  intangible asset for impa irment. The Company revised its cash flow forecasts for Zerbaxa  utilizing certain assumptions around the return to market timeline and\nanticipated uptake in sales thereafter . These revised cash flow forecasts indicated that the Zerbaxa  intangible asset value was not fully recoverable on an undiscounted\ncash flows basis. The Company utilized market participant assumptions to determine its best estimate of the fair value of the intangible asset related to Zerbaxa  that, when\ncompared with its related carrying value, resulte d in the impairment charge noted above.

Amounts capitalized as IPR&D are accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets, subject to impairment testing\nuntil completion or aband onment of the projects.  Upon successful completion of each IPR&D project, the Company will make a separate determination as to the then-useful\nlife of the asset and begin amortization.\nIn 2022, the Company recorded $1.7 billion of intangible impairment charges within Research and development  expenses, of which $1.6 billion represents\nIPR&D impa irment charges related to nemtabrutinib (MK-1026), a novel, oral BTK inhibitor currently being evaluated for the treatment of B-cell malignancies that was\nobtained through the 2020 acquisition of ArQule (see Note 4). Following discussions with regulatory authorities in the third quarter , the development period for nemtabrutinib\nwas extended, which constituted a triggering event that required the evaluation of the nemtabrutin ib intangible asset for impairment. The Company estimated the current fair\nvalue of nemtabrutinib utilizing an income approach which calculates the present value of projected future cash flows. The market participant assumptions used to derive\nthe forecasted cash flows were updated to reflect a delay in the anticipated launch date for nemtabrutinib, which resulted in lower cumulative revenue forecasts and a\nreduction in the estimated fair value. The revised  estimated fair value of nemtabrutinib when compared with its related carrying value resulted in a $807 million impairment\ncharge recor ded in the third quarter of 2022.

The market participant assumptions used to derive the\nforecasted cash flows were updated to reflect the current competitive landscape for nemtabrutinib, including increased expected development costs for additional clinical\ntrial data needed to develop nemtabrutinib, as well as a delay in the anticipated launch date for nemtabrutinib, which collectively reduced the projected future cash flows\nand estimate d fair value. Additionally , the discount rate utilized to determine the current fair value of the asset was reduced to 8.5% to reflect the current risk profile of the\nasset. The revised estimated fair value of nemtabrutinib when compared with its related carrying value resulted in the IPR&D impairment charge noted above.\n101", "start_char_idx": 3845, "end_char_idx": 5985, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e36589be-5335-46e9-86db-10772726c7c0": {"__data__": {"id_": "e36589be-5335-46e9-86db-10772726c7c0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "104", "file_name": "merck_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "data\\merck_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf_part_103", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "104", "file_name": "merck_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "9dbd2a1fb8b1cf5583857170d06ee6eca14ad69119aa6fba71e847bdeb88b882"}}, "hash": "9dbd2a1fb8b1cf5583857170d06ee6eca14ad69119aa6fba71e847bdeb88b882", "text": "Table of Contents\nIn 2020, the Company recorded a $90 million IPR&D impairment charge related to a decision to discontinue the development program for COVID-19 vaccine\ncandidate V591 following Merck\u2019 s review of findin gs from a Phase 1 clinical study for the vaccine.

The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. When evaluating contracts for embedded leases, the Company exercises judgment\nto determine  if there is an explicit or implicit identified asset in the contract and if Merck controls the use of that asset. Embedded leases, primarily associated with contract\nmanufacturing organizations, are immaterial. The lease term includes options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that Merck will exercise that\noption. Real estate leases for facilities have an average remaining lease term of seven years , which include options to extend the leases for up to four years where\napplicable. Vehicle leases are generally in effect for four years. The Company elected to exclude  short-term leases (leases with an initial term of 12 months or less) from the\nlease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet.\nLease expense for operating lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Operating lease assets and liabilities are\nrecognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Since the Comp any\u2019s leases do not have a readily determinable implicit discount rate, the\nCompany uses its increm ental borrowing rate to calculate the present value of lease payments by asset class. On a quarterly basis, an updated incremental borrowing rate\nis determined based on the average remaining lease term of each asset class and the Company\u2019 s pretax cost of debt for that same term. The updated rates for each asset\nclass are applied prospectively to new leases. The Company does not separate lease components (e.g. payments for rent, real estate taxes and insurance costs) from non-\nlease components (e.g. common-area maintena nce costs) in the event that the agreement contains both. Merck includes both the lease and non-lease components for\npurposes of calculating the right-of-use asset and related lease liability (if the non-lease compo nents are fixed). For vehicle leases and employee housing, the Company\napplies a portfolio approach to account for the operating lease assets and liabilities.\nCertain of the Company\u2019 s lease agreements contain variable lease payments that are adjusted periodically for inflation or for actual operating expense true-ups\ncompared with estimated amounts; however , these amounts are immaterial. Sublease income and activity related to sale and leaseback transactions are immaterial.\nMerck\u2019 s lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.\nOperating lease cost was $334 million in 2022, $343 million in 2021 and $340 million in 2020. Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating\nlease liabilities was $335  million in 2022, $340 million in 2021 and $334 million in 2020. Operatin g lease assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations were $57 million\nin 2022, $1 17 million in 2021 and $473 million in 2020.\nSupplemental balance sheet information related to operating leases is as follows:\nDecember 31 2022 2021\nAssets\nOther Assets $ 1,346  $ 1,586 \nLiabilities\nAccrued and other current liabilities 281 304 \nOther Noncurrent Liabilities 1,013  1,225 \n$ 1,294  $ 1,529 \nWeighted-average remaining lease term (years) 7.0 7.0\nWeighted-average discount rate 3.1 % 2.6 %\nIncludes prepaid leases that have no related lease liability.(1)\n(1)    \n104", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3602, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6e876ac4-cac6-4fce-afed-a82560b63f0e": {"__data__": {"id_": "6e876ac4-cac6-4fce-afed-a82560b63f0e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "107", "file_name": "merck_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "data\\merck_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf_part_106", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "107", "file_name": "merck_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "885f07dde88741dd48cb3b0267e9cbfd01aba9ba0a3edbf9fbe683195b999246"}, "3": {"node_id": "4649dfb1-530b-4255-9cdf-ed0dd3050a44", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "107", "file_name": "merck_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "f231cb0845f2dcedd5dfe014dc44592ae3b7f607364e9eed0c421150ba642f45"}}, "hash": "d8a841267e65e821f119aff06767d58705ffa1899a81d1a79ee13460c4ab27c5", "text": "Table of Contents\nMaturities of operating leases liabilities are as follows:\n2023 $ 323 \n2024 258 \n2025 224 \n2026 157 \n2027 126 \nThereafter 404 \nTotal lease payments 1,492 \nLess: Imputed interest 198 \n$ 1,294 \nAt December 31, 2022, the Company had entered into additional real estate operating leases that had not yet commenced; the obligations associated with these\nleases total $232 million.\n11.    Contingencies and Environmental Liabilities\nThe Compan y is involved in various claims and legal proceedings of a nature considered normal to its business, including product liability , intellectual property ,\nand commercial litigation, as well as certain additional matters including governmental and environmental matters. In the opinion of the Company , it is unlikely that the\nresolution of these matters will be material to the Company\u2019 s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nGiven the nature of the litigation discussed below  and the complexities involved in these matters , the Company is unable to reasonably estimate a possible loss\nor range of possible loss for such matters until the Company knows, among other factors, (i) what claims, if any, will survive dispositive motion practice, (ii) the extent of the\nclaims, including the size of any potential class,  particularly when damages are not specified or are indeterminate, (iii) how the discovery process will affect the litigation,\n(iv) the settlement posture of the other parties to the litigation and (v) any other factors that may have a material ef fect on the litigation.\nThe Company records accruals for contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. These\naccruals are adjusted periodically as assessments change or additional information becomes available. For product liability claims, a portion of the overall accrual is\nactuarially determined and considers such factors as past experience, number of claims reported and estimates of claims incurred but not yet reported. Individually\nsignificant contingent losses are accrued when probable and reasonably estimable. Legal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency are\naccrued when probable and reasonably estimable.\nThe Company\u2019 s decision to obtain insurance coverage is dependent on market conditions, includ ing cost and availability , existing at the time such decisions are\nmade. The Company has evaluated its risks and has determined that the cost of obtaining product liability insurance outweighs the likely benefits of the coverage that is\navailable and, as such, has no insurance for most product liabilities.\nProduct Liability Litigation\nGardasil/Gardasil 9\nAs previously disclosed, Merck is a defendant in product liability lawsuits in the U.S. involving Gardasil (Human Papillomavirus Quadrivalent [Types 6, 11, 16 and\n18] Vaccine, Recombinant) and Gardasil  9 (Human Papillomavirus 9-valent Vaccine, Recombinant). As of December 31, 2022, approximately 70 cases were filed and\npending against Merck in either federal or state court. In these actions, plaintif fs allege, among  other things, that they suffered various personal injuries after vaccination\nwith Gardasil or Gardasil  9, with postural orthost atic tachycardia syndrome as a predominate alleged injury . In August 2022, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation\nordered that Gardasil/Gardasil  9 product liability case s pending in federal courts nationwide be transferred to Judge Robert  J. Conrad in the Western District of North\nCarolina for coordinated pre-trial proceedings. There are fewer than 15 product liability cases pending outside the U.S., including one purported class action in Colombia.\nGovernmental Proceedings\nAs previousl y disclosed, in the fall of 2018, the Company received a records subpoena from the U.S. Attorney\u2019 s Office for the District of Vermont (VT", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3914, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4649dfb1-530b-4255-9cdf-ed0dd3050a44": {"__data__": {"id_": "4649dfb1-530b-4255-9cdf-ed0dd3050a44", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "107", "file_name": "merck_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "data\\merck_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf_part_106", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "107", "file_name": "merck_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "885f07dde88741dd48cb3b0267e9cbfd01aba9ba0a3edbf9fbe683195b999246"}, "2": {"node_id": "6e876ac4-cac6-4fce-afed-a82560b63f0e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "107", "file_name": "merck_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "d8a841267e65e821f119aff06767d58705ffa1899a81d1a79ee13460c4ab27c5"}}, "hash": "f231cb0845f2dcedd5dfe014dc44592ae3b7f607364e9eed0c421150ba642f45", "text": "from the U.S. Attorney\u2019 s Office for the District of Vermont (VT USAO)\npursuant to Section 248 of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) relating to an investigation of potential health care offenses.

(PFI), a cloud-based, electronic health\nrecords (EHR) company that was acquired by Allscripts in January 2018. The Company coopera ted with the government and responded to that subpoena. Subsequently , in\nMay 2019, Merck receiv ed a second records subpoena from the VT USAO that broadened the government\u2019 s information request by seeking information relating to Merck\u2019 s\nrelationship with any EHR company . Shortly thereafter , the VT USAO served a Civil Investigation Demand (CID) upon Merck similarly seeking information on the Company\u2019 s\nrelationships with EHR vendors. The CID explains that the government is conducting a False Claims Act investigation concerning whether Merck and/or PFI submitted\nclaims to federal health care programs that violate the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Merck is cooperating with the government\u2019 s investigation.\nAs previous ly disclosed, in April 2019, Merck received a set of investigative interrogatories from the California Attorney General\u2019 s Office pursuant to its\ninvestigation of conduct and agreements that allegedly affected or delayed competition to Lantus in the insulin market. The interrogatories seek information concerning\nMerck\u2019 s development of an insulin glargine product, and its subsequent termination, as well as Merck\u2019 s patent litigation against Sanofi S.A. concerning Lantus and the\nresolution of that litigation. Merck is cooperating with the California Attorney General\u2019 s investigation.\nAs previously disclosed, in June 2020, Merck received a CID from the U.S. Department of Justice. The CID requests answers to interrogatories, as well as\nvarious docu ments, regarding temperature excursions at a third-party storage facility containing certain Merck products. Merck is cooperating with the government\u2019 s\ninvestigation and intends to produce information and/or documents as necessary in response to the CID.\nAs previously disclosed, from time to time, the Company\u2019 s subsidiaries in China receive inquiries regarding their operations from various Chinese governmental\nagencies. Some of these  inquiries may be related to matters involving other multinational pharmaceutical companies, as well as Chinese entities doing business with such\ncompanies. The Company\u2019 s policy is to cooperate with these authorities and to provide responses as appropriate.\nAs previously disclosed, from time to time, the Company receives inquiries and is the subject of preliminary investigation activities from competition and other\ngovernmental authorities in markets outside the U.S. These authorities may include regulators, administrative authorities, and law enforcement and other similar officials,\nand these preliminary investigation activities may include site visits, formal or informal requests or demands for documents or materials, inquiries or interviews and similar\nmatters. Certain of these preliminary inquiries or activities may lead to the commencement of formal proceedings.

HRSA \u2019s letter to Merck asserts that Merck is in violation of the 340B statute. HRSA\nfurther claims that continued failure to provide the 340B price to covered entities using contra ct pharmacies may result in civil monetary penalties for each instance of\nalleged overcharging, in addition to repayment for any instance of overcharging. The letter is very similar to letters HRSA  has sent to other manufacturers, which letters\nhave been held to be unlawful by multiple federal courts. Merck disagrees with HRSA \u2019s assertion. Merck remains committed to the 340B Program and to providing 340B\ndiscounts to eligible covered entities. Merck\u2019 s 340B Program integrity initiative is consistent with the requirements of the 340B statute and is intended to ensure the integrity\nand sustainability of the 340B statute by reducin g prohibited duplicate discounts and diversion and putting patients back at the center of the program.

To protect its patent rights, the Company may file patent infringement\nlawsuits against such generic companies. Simila r lawsuits defending the Company\u2019 s patent rights may exist in other countries. The Company intends to vigorously defend\nits patents, which it believes are valid, against infringement by companies attempting to market products prior to the expiration of such patents. As with any litigation, there\ncan be no assurance of the outcomes, which, if adverse, could result in significantly shortene d periods of exclusivity for these products and, with respect to products\nacquired through acquisitions accounted for as business combinations, potentially significant intangible asset impairment charges.\nBridion \u2014 As previously disclosed, between January and November 2020, the Company received multiple  Paragraph IV Certification Letters under the Hatch-\nWaxman Act notifying the Company that generic  drug companies have filed applications to the FDA seeking pre-patent expiry approval to sell generic versions of Bridion\n(sugammadex) Injection. In March, April and December 2020, the Company filed patent infringe ment lawsuits in the U.S. District Courts for the District of New Jersey and\nthe Northern District of West Virginia against those generic companies. All actions in the District of New Jersey have been consolidated. These lawsuits, which assert one or\nmore patent s covering sugammadex and method s of using sugammadex, automatically stay FDA approval of the generic applications until June 2023 or until adverse court\ndecisions, if any, whiche ver may occur earlier . The West Virginia case was jointly dismissed with prejudice on August 8, 2022 in favor of proceeding in New Jersey . The\nremaining defendants in the New Jersey action have stipulated to infringement of the asserted claims and have stated they are withdrawing all remaining claims and\ndefenses other than a defense seeking to shorte n the patent term extension of the sugammade x patent to December 2022. The U.S. District Court for the District of New\nJersey held a one-day trial on December 19, 2022 on this remaining patent term extension calculation defense. The court ordered a post-trial briefing on this defense and\nheld closing arguments on February 3, 2023.\nThe Company has settled with five generic companies providing that these generic companies can bring their generic versions of Bridion  to the market in\nJanuary 2026 (which may be delayed by any applicable pediatric exclusivity) or earlier under certain circumstances. The Company has agreed to stay the lawsuit filed\nagainst two generic companies, which in excha nge agreed to be bound by a judgment on the merits of the consolidated action in the District of New Jersey . One of the\ngeneric companies in the consolidated action requested dismissal of the action against it and the Company did not oppose this request, which was subsequently granted by\nthe court. The Company  does not expect this company to bring its generic version of Bridion to the marke t before January 2026 or later, depending on any applicable\npediatric exclusivity , unless the Company receives an adverse court decision.\nJanuvia, Janumet, Janumet XR \u2014 As previo usly disclos ed, the FDA granted pediatric exclusivity with respect to Januvia (sitagliptin), Janumet\n(sitagliptin/metformin HCl), and Janumet XR (sitag liptin", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3907, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bd1231e4-cc34-4545-8a58-cb35ad51cbff": {"__data__": {"id_": "bd1231e4-cc34-4545-8a58-cb35ad51cbff", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "110", "file_name": "merck_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "data\\merck_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf_part_109", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "110", "file_name": "merck_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "f1a0a988fd8e01b4d243880877fb744a04b2069f6ba3506750d498905505d55a"}, "2": {"node_id": "311f2588-35b4-4291-9b29-f246c32b48d5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "110", "file_name": "merck_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "2ad366521147235e8d1ec3390823bd3c19cab8ee6476cc4ac9a0f36d6bf76bf5"}}, "hash": "e04cf071db68a0ed9edd736afb669d590b270d880c1070d0d42960d9acb32df0", "text": "HCl), and Janumet XR (sitag liptin and metformin HCl extended-releas e), which provides a further six months of exclusivity in the U.S. beyond the\nexpiration of all patents listed in the FDA\u2019s Orange Book.

The USPT O instituted IPR proceedings in May 2020, finding a reasonable likelihood that the challenged claims are not\nvalid. A trial was held in February 2021 and a final decision was rendered in May 2021, holding that all of the challenged claims were not invalid.

However , certain of the rulings are currently being appealed,\nand an unfavorable court decision would likely cause the products to lose exclusivity toward the end of 2023.\nGeneric companies have sought revocation of the Supplementary Protection Certificate (SPC)  for Janumet  in a number of Europe an countries. In Februa ry\n2022, a Finnish court referred certain questions to the Court of Justice of the European Union that could determine the validity of the Janumet  SPCs in Europe, for which\nthere will be an oral hearing on March 8, 2023. In first instance decisions, the Janumet  SPC has been found invalid in Germany and Romania, and has been upheld in\nCzech Repu blic and Sweden.

These proceedings seek to require the operators of hazardous waste disposal\nfacilities, transporters of waste to the sites and generators of hazardous waste disposed of at the sites to clean up the sites or to reimburse the government for cleanup\ncosts. The Company has been made a party to these proceedings as an alleged generator of waste disposed of at the sites. In each case, the government alleges that the\ndefendants are jointly and severally liable for the cleanup costs. Although joint and several liability is alleged, these proceedings are frequently resolved so that the\nallocation of cleanup costs among the parties more nearly reflects the relative contributions of the parties to the site situation. The Company\u2019 s potential liability varies greatly\nfrom site to site. For some sites the potential liability is de minimis  and for others the final costs of cleanup have not yet been determined. While it is not feasible to predict\nthe outcome  of many of these proceedings brought by federal or state agencies or private litigan ts, in the opinion of the Company , such proceedings should not ultimately\nresult in any liability which would have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations or liquidity of the Company . The Company has taken an\nactive role in identifying and accruing for these costs and such amounts do not include any reduction for anticipated recoveries of cleanup costs from former site owners or\noperators or other recalcitrant potentially responsible parties.\nIn management\u2019 s opinion, the liabilities for all environmental matters that are probable and reasonably estimable have been accrued and totaled $39 million and\n$40 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively . These liabilities are undiscounted, do not consider potential recoveries from other parties and will be paid out over\nthe periods of remediation for the applicable sites, which are expected to occur primarily over the next 15 years. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the\noutcome of these matter s, or the ultimate costs of remediation, management does not believe that any reasonably possible expenditures that may be incurred in excess of\nthe liabilities  accrued should exceed approximately $35 million in the aggregate. Management also does not believe that these expenditures should result in a material\nadverse ef fect on the Company\u2019 s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity for any year .\n12.

These awards generally vest one-third\neach year over a three-y ear period, with a contractual term of 7-10 years. RSUs are stock award s that are granted to employees and entitle the holder to shares of common\nstock as the awards vest. The fair value of the stock option and RSU awards is determined and fixed on the grant date based on the Company\u2019 s stock price.

In applying this model, the Company uses both\nhistorical data and current market data to estimate the fair value of its options. The Black-Scholes model requires several assumptions including expected dividend yield,\nrisk-free interest rate, volatility , and term of the options. The expected dividend yield is based on historical patterns of dividend payments. The risk-free interest rate is based\non the rate at grant date of zero-coupon U.S. Treasury Notes with a term equal to the expected term of the option. Expected volatility is estimated using a blend of historical\nand implied volatility . The historical component is based on historical monthly price changes. The implied volatility is obtained from market data on the Company\u2019 s traded\noptions. The expected life represents the amount of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding, based on historical and forecasted exercise behavior .\nThe weighted average exercise price of options granted in 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $87.10, $75.99 and $77.67 per option, respectively .

measuring\nfair value. There are three levels of inputs used to measure fair value with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest:\nLevel 1  \u2014 Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2 \u2014 Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, or other inputs that are observable or can be\ncorroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3 \u2014 Unobser vable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity . The Level 3 assets are those whose values are determined using pricing models,\ndiscounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques with significant unobservable inputs, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires\nsignificant judgment or estimation.

The expected rate of return for both the pension and other postretirement benefit plans represents the average rate of return to be earned on plan assets over\nthe period the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid and is determined on a plan basis. The expected rate of return for each plan is developed considering\nlong-term historical returns data, current market conditions, and actual returns on the plan asse ts. Using this reference information, the long-term return expectations for\neach asset category and a weighted-average expected return for each plan\u2019 s target portfolio is developed according to the allocation among those investment categories.\nThe expected portfolio performance reflects the contribution of active management as appropria te. For 2023, the expected rate of return for the Company\u2019 s U.S. pension\nand other postretirement benefit plans will be 7.00%, as compared to 6.70% in 2022.\nThe health care cost trend rate assumptions for other postretirement benefit plans are as follows:\nDecember 31 2022 2021\nHealth care cost trend rate assumed for next year 7.8 % 6.4 %\nRate to which the cost trend rate is assumed to decline 4.5 % 4.5 %\nYear that the trend rate reaches the ultimate trend rate 2038 2032\nSavings Plans\nThe Compan y also maintains defined contributio n savings plans in the U.S. The Company matches a percentage of each employee\u2019 s contributions consistent\nwith the provisions of the plan for which the employee is eligible.

The Company\u2019 s\nreserves for unrecognized tax benefits for the years under examination exceeded the adjustment s relating to this examination period and therefore the Company recorded a\n$236 million  net tax benefit in 2021 (of which $207 million related to continuing operations and $29 million related to discontinued operations).

The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial\nstatements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below , providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts\nor disclosures to which it relates.\nU.S. Rebate Accruals - Medicaid, Managed Care and Medicare Part D\nAs described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company records certain variable consideration including discounts, which are estimated at the time of\nsale generally using the expected value method. Amounts accrued for aggregate customer discounts are evaluated on a quarterly basis through comparison of information\nprovided by the wholesa lers, health maintenance organizations, pharmacy benefit managers, federal and state agencies, and other customers to the amounts accrued.\nCertain of these discounts representing a portion of the accrual take the form of rebates, which are amounts owed based upon definitive contractual agreements or legal\nrequirements with private sector (Managed Care) and public sector (Medicaid and Medicare Part D) benefit providers, after the final dispensing of the product to a benefit\nplan particip ant. The provision for rebates is based on expected patient usage, as well as inventory levels in the distribution channel to determine the contractual obligation\nto the benefi t providers. Management uses historical customer segment utilization mix, sales forecasts, changes to product mix and price, inventory levels in the distribution\nchannel, government pricing calculations and prior payment history in order to estimate the expected provision. The accrued balance relative to the provision for rebates\nincluded in accrued and other current liabilities was $2.7 billion as of December 31, 2022, of which the majority relates to U.S. rebate accruals \u2013 Medicaid, Managed Care\nand Medicare Part D.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to U.S. rebate accruals - Medicaid, Managed Care and Medicare Part D is a critical\naudit matter  are the significant judgment by management due to the significant measurement uncertainty involved in developing the rebate accruals, as the accruals are\nbased on assumptions developed using pricing information and historical customer segment utilization mix, and a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in\nperforming procedures and evaluating evidence related to these assumptions.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial\nstatements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to U.S. rebate accruals - Medicaid, Managed Care and Medicare Part D, including\nmanagement\u2019 s controls over the assumptions used to estimate the corresponding rebate accruals. These procedures also included, among others (i) developing an\nindependent estimate of the rebate accruals by utilizing third party data on historical customer segment utilization mix in the U.S., pricing information, the terms of the\nspecific rebate programs , and the historical trend of actual rebate claims paid, (ii) comparing the independent estimate to the rebate accruals recorded by management, and\n(iii) testing rebate claims paid, including evaluating those claims for consistency with the contractual terms of the Company\u2019 s rebate agreements.\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nFlorham Park, New Jersey\nFebruary 24, 2023\nWe have served as the Company\u2019 s auditor since 2002.\n129", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4072, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "159c5fce-4c13-47ca-9dcd-9cbadeae9be0": {"__data__": {"id_": "159c5fce-4c13-47ca-9dcd-9cbadeae9be0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "132", "file_name": "merck_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "data\\merck_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf_part_131", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "132", "file_name": "merck_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "6b737d4bdb403544575a53d6c5dc8d54d1a2920506a2ac5450d78be0ed4fdc92"}, "3": {"node_id": "242f6fc1-8cec-4d4d-948e-d8baab83ef4f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "132", "file_name": "merck_sec_filings_10k_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "48025a66ed4aa8351f227546a62546149b8b400ae32b6680cad8b34b84cd85d4"}}, "hash": "6710dee7a7896120efc112905e63dcce6b526e62d9bef2ffb81f194ff95bd614", "text": "Table of Contents\nItem 9.

This PSU Award will be subject to recoupment in the event of violations of the Company policy for\nRecoupment of Compensation for Compliance violations as set forth in Appendix A as amended from time to time. In addition, PSUs, and\nany proceeds therefrom, are subject to the Company\u2019s right to reclaim their benefits in the event of a significant restatement of financial\nresults for any Award Period, pursuant to the process described below.\n1. The Audit Committee of the Board will review the issues and circumstances that resulted in a restatement of financial results\nto determine if the restatement was significant and make an initial determination of the cause of the restatement\u2014that is whether the\nrestatement was caused, in whole or in part, by Executive Fault (as those terms are defined below); and\n2. The Compensation and Benefits Committee of the Board will (a) recalculate the Company's results for any Award Period\nwith respect to PSUs that included an Award Period which occurred during the restatement period; and (b) if it is determined that such\nrestatement was caused in whole or in part by the Executive's Fault, the Compensation and Benefits Committee will seek reimbursement\nfrom the Executive of that portion of the payout of the PSU that the Executive received within 18 months of the restatement based on the\nerroneous financial results.\nB. \u201cExecutive\u201d means executive officers for the purposes of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\nC. \u201cFault\u201d means fraud or willful misconduct. \"Willful misconduct\" is generally viewed as dereliction of a duty or unlawful or\nimproper behavior committed voluntarily and intentionally; something more than negligence.

Exclusions from Clawback. This Section does not apply to restatements that the Audit Committee determines (1) are required\nor permitted under generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) in connection with the adoption or implementation of a new\naccounting standard or (2) are caused due to the Company's decision to change its accounting practice as permitted under GAAP.\nE.

This PSU Award will be subject to recoupment in the event of violations of the Company policy for\nRecoupment of Compensation for Compliance violations as set forth in Appendix A as amended from time to time. In addition, PSUs, and\nany proceeds therefrom, are subject to the Company\u2019s right to reclaim their benefits in the event of a significant restatement of financial\nresults for any Award Period, pursuant to the process described below.\n1. The Audit Committee of the Board will review the issues and circumstances that resulted in a restatement of financial results\nto determine if the restatement was significant and make an initial determination of the cause of the restatement\u2014that is whether the\nrestatement was caused, in whole or in part, by Executive Fault (as those terms are defined below); and\n2. The Compensation and Benefits Committee of the Board will (a) recalculate the Company's results for any Award Period\nwith respect to PSUs that included an Award Period which occurred during the restatement period; and (b) if it is determined that such\nrestatement was caused in whole or in part by the Executive's Fault, the Compensation and Benefits Committee will seek reimbursement\nfrom the Executive of that portion of the payout of the PSU that the Executive received within 18 months of the restatement based on the\nerroneous financial results.\nB. \u201cExecutive\u201d means executive officers for the purposes of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\nC. \u201cFault\u201d means fraud or willful misconduct. \"Willful misconduct\" is generally viewed as dereliction of a duty or unlawful or\nimproper behavior committed voluntarily and intentionally; something more than negligence.

Exclusions from Clawback. This Section does not apply to restatements that the Audit Committee determines (1) are required\nor permitted under generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) in connection with the adoption or implementation of a new\naccounting standard or (2) are caused due to the Company's decision to change its accounting practice as permitted under GAAP.\nE.

For Executive Team members, annual grants generally include a mix of non-qualified stock options and performance share units (PSUs),\nwith the number and proportion of shares covered by such incentives determined by the Compensation and Management Development Committee of\nthe Board of Directors of Merck (the \"Committee\"). The current annual grant value for the Position is $2,500,000, comprised of 70% PSUs and 30%\nnon-qualified stock options.
